description: "ArmaPET\xAE Eco50 is a low-density polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\
  \ foam, based on 100% recycled plastic bottles. Its long-term stability of the insulation\
  \ properties and the low thermal conductivity secure lifetime insulation performance.\
  \ The water resistance and the closed-cell structure of the material ensure stable\
  \ thermal conductivity even after many years of operation. These features also prevent\
  \ moisture penetration, mildew and rot and therefore offer long-term corrosion protection\
  \ and minimal maintenance requirements.\nAdditionally, the material can be thermoformed\
  \ into curved shapes, welded in pre-fabrication or on site, and is versatile for\
  \ use in almost any type of finishing options. Its thermoplastic nature also allows\
  \ for full recyclability of the material after the use phase.\nThanks to Armacells\
  \ patented rPET technology, ArmaPET\xAE Eco50 is based on 100% recycled PET and\
  \ is manufactured according to an energy and resource optimised production process:\
  \ with the re-use of waste material and no use of ozone-depleting hydrofluorocarbons\
  \ (HFC) or chlorofluorcocarbons (CFC) blowing agents."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis document relates to ArmaPET\xAE Eco50.\
  \ For the creation of the life cycle assessment, specific data was collected from\
  \ the manufacturing plant in Thimister-Clermont in Belgium of the Armacell Group,\
  \ which corresponds to the annual average and is based on data from 2022 (see 3.8\
  \ allocation). The owner of the declaration is liable for the information and evidence\
  \ on which it is based; the IBU accepts no liability for manufacturer information,\
  \ life cycle assessment data and evidence. \nSystem boundary: \nThe type of the\
  \ EPD is from the cradle to the factory gate with options, modules C1-C4 and module\
  \ D. The following information modules are defined as system limits in this study:\
  \ \n\nA1\u2013A5 Product development: \nA1 \u2013 Production of raw materials\n\
  A2 \u2013 Transport to the manufacturer\nA3 \u2013 Production\nA4 \u2013 Transport\
  \ from the factory gate to the construction site\nA5 \u2013 Installation of the\
  \ products in the building \n\nEnd of life stage (C1- C4): \nC1, deconstruction/demolition,\n\
  C2, transport,\nC3, waste treatment ,\nC4, disposal. \n\nReuse, recovery and recycling\
  \ potential (D) \n\nIn order to precisely record the indicators and environmental\
  \ impacts of the declared unit, a total of 8 information modules are considered.\
  \ The information modules A1 to A3 describe the provision of materials, the transport\
  \ to the production site, as well as the production processes of the product itself.\n\
  \n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nArmaPET Eco50 foam boards are\
  \ manufactured based on mechanically recycled PET, applying the patented technology\
  \ of Armacell. This method is based on reprocessing post- consumer PET waste to\
  \ produce recycled flakes, after separation of the polymer from contaminants. It\
  \ includes sorting and separating of waste, washing it to remove any dirt and contaminants,\
  \ and further grinding, crushing and sorting carried out by Armacell's suppliers.\
  \ The recycled product is compliant with the predefined specification of Armacell\
  \ and is supplied in the form of flakes and granules. At Armacell, the flakes are\
  \ processed into granules by melt- extrusion. The granulation process includes pre-drying\
  \ the flakes to avoid hydrolysis in the extrusion process. The pre- dryed flakes\
  \ are fed into an extruder where the material is molten and homogenized. A vacuum\
  \ extraction section is used to remove volatile contaminants from the melt. After\
  \ final filtration the material is granulated by underwater cutting followed by\
  \ crystallization of the obtained rPET granules. Obtained recycled PET granules\
  \ are further processed into foam through foaming extrusion, in the presence of\
  \ halogen- free supercritical fluid used as a physical blowing agent. Further components\
  \ of the foam include additives for foam nucleation, cell stabilization and melt\
  \ modification. The patented method of rPET treatment and modification during melt\
  \ processing allows Armacell to overcome the main disadvantage of mechanical recycling\
  \ \u2013 a decline in the product quality \u2013 and to upgrade the quality despite\
  \ the thermal degradation, photo-oxidation and mechanical stresses. Another component\
  \ of the formulation is 'PET Agglomerate', which is obtained from reclaimed PET\
  \ foam. The primary source of agglomerate is the PET dust generated by the lateral\
  \ and surface grinding operations in the downstream of the foam extrusion process\
  \ (Eco50 internal loop). Another source of agglomerate, is PET foam which is diverted\
  \ from the waste stream of other PET foam products at Armacell. All reclaimed foam\
  \ cut-offs are crushed and compacted in a first step. In the second step, the pre-\
  \ compacted particles are mixed with reclaimed PET dust and partially molten by\
  \ shear forces and formed into agglomerate through a template. The extruded foamed\
  \ PET boards with homogeneous and closed-cell structure are calibrated, edge cut\
  \ and surface grinded to obtain the final product with the required dimensions and\
  \ surface planarity. \nTechnical data: \nFor further technical data consult the\
  \ product datasheet available on\nthe website. Acoustic properties are not relevant\
  \ for ArmaPET\xAE Eco50. \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared product is an ArmaPET Eco50.\
  \ The declared unit relates to 1 m of product. The packaging with 3,039 kg is also\
  \ included in the calculation. The following table shows the data of the declared\
  \ unit."
