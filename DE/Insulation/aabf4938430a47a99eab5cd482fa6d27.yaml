lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe EPD represents cellular glass produced\
  \ at the GLAPOR production site at Mitterteich/GER. \nSystem boundary: \nType of\
  \ EPD: \"cradle to gate with options, modules C1-C3, and module D (A1\u2013A3, C,\
  \ D and additional modules. The additional modules may be A4 and/or A5 and/or B1\u2013\
  B7)\".\n\nThe system boundary of module A1\u2013A3 encompasses all processes related\
  \ to the production of cellular glass. The system boundary for the recycled glass\
  \ is assumed to be after the sorting of the glass cullets that are to be recycled.\
  \ Within the system boundary of A1\u2013A3 are considered:\n\ngrinding of recycled\
  \ glass cullets\nproduction of all ancillary materials\nelectricity production\n\
  heat generation for the production process\nproduction of packaging material\nall\
  \ transport, including transport of glass cullets to the external grinding and transport\
  \ of inputs to the production site.The process does not generate waste water. \n\
  \nThe process generates about 30 % of production waste that is used for the production\
  \ of cellular glass gravel. For this product an economic allocation is applied.\n\
  \nNo other waste is generated in significant quantities.\n\nModule A4 contains the\
  \ average transport scenario from the production site to the construction site.\n\
  \nModule A5 contains the disposal of the PE packaging in a municipal waste incineration\
  \ plant, from which energy is exported from the product system; the benefits of\
  \ this exported energy are reported in Module D.\nModule C1 does not contain any\
  \ impacts as manual de-construction is assumed.\n\nAfter de-construction, 2 scenarios\
  \ are declared\n\nScenario 1: recycling into cellular glass gravel\n\nModule C2/1\
  \ contains a default transport scenario (350 km by lorry) of the cellular glass\
  \ from the deconstruction site to the GLAPOR production site (see also module A4).\n\
  \nModule C3/1 contains the electricity consumption used to crush the deconstructed\
  \ cellular foam board into gravel smaller than 60 mm.\n\nModule D/1 contains the\
  \ benefits of replacing natural crushed gravel, calculated for the net flow calculated\
  \ as the difference between the output of recycled cellular glass and the input\
  \ of glass cullet. It also includes the exported energy from the energy recovery\
  \ from the treatment of PE in a municipal waste incineration plant.\n\nScenario\
  \ 2: landfilling:\n\nModule C2/2 contains a default transport scenario (50 km by\
  \ lorry) of the cellular glass from the deconstruction site to the inert material\
  \ landfill.\n\nModule C4/2 contains the landfilling of the cellular glass.\n\nModule\
  \ D/2 contains the benefits of the exported energy from the energy recovery from\
  \ the treatment of PE in a municipal waste incineration plant.\n\n# Technology Description\
  \ And Included Processes\n\nGLAPOR cellular glass is composed of: 87% of recycled\
  \ glass 12% of sodium silicate (\"water glass\") 1% of glycerineIn addition, minor\
  \ quantities of kaolin are used. This cellular glass is directly foamed from recycled\
  \ waste glass. The recycled waste glass cannot be used for the bottle or float glass\
  \ industry due to unwanted colour effects. This newly developed process uses glycerine\
  \ as foaming agent and water glass as protection against spontaneous combustion\
  \ of the glycerine before sintering. As a consequence, GLAPOR cellular glass is\
  \ foamed in a neutral atmosphere with a much better combustion efficiency. This\
  \ implies also that no melting furnace is required. The glycerine / water glass\
  \ process develops a much finer cell structure for a certain fineness of the glass\
  \ because the water glass (sodium silicate) acts as a sintering aid. As a consequence,\
  \ the energy rich grinding process with a ball mill can be limited to a minimum\
  \ for the glycerine process. The majority of cellular glass producers is using the\
  \ mould process, where the cellular glass is produced as a cake. Shaping the 'cake\u201D\
  \ to strictly rectangular dimensions involves a lot of waste up to at least 50%.\
  \ GLAPOR cellular glass is foamed as wide ribbon (continuous foaming) with an almost\
  \ rectangular shape. As a consequence, the shaping of the ribbon to strict rectangular\
  \ blocks involves less than 30% waste. Because the continuous process does not involve\
  \ stripping of the foam from a mould, it is possible to connect annealing and foaming\
  \ furnace. At GLAPOR, the annealing furnace is almost 100% heated with the flue\
  \ gases of the foaming furnace. \nDeclared unit: \nThe declaration is valid for\
  \ 1 m3 of GLAPOR cellular glass with a density of 120 kg/m3, with a typical thickness\
  \ of 160 mm and with a thermal conductivity of 0.054 W/(mK) (Source: Fraunhofer\
  \ 2017)."
