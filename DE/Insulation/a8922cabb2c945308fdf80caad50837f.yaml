lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe Life Cycle Assessment is based on the\
  \ life cycle of unfaced and uncoated synthetic resin-bonded stone wool produced\
  \ by ROCKWOOL. The LCA results of the facings are listed in the Annex. The stone\
  \ wool is produced in the plants in Gladbeck, Neuburg and Flechtingen in which production\
  \ data was recorded for 2008 and complemented by generic data for the facings in\
  \ 2015. The Life Cycle Assessment therefore represents all of the stone wool produced\
  \ by ROCKWOOL. This document is a translation from German into English. It is based\
  \ on the original declaration EPD-DRW-20120111-IBC2-DE. \nSystem boundary: \nType\
  \ of EPD: cradle to grave, with options\nThe Life Cycle Assessment takes into account\
  \ the life cycle phases of stone wool production (Modules A1\u2013A3), disposal\
  \ of the packaging arising during installation (Module A5) and the subsequent-use\
  \ phase (Modules C2 and C4). Credits based on thermal utilization of the packaging\
  \ are allocated to Module D. Credits arising from landfilling (Module C4) are also\
  \ allocated to Module D.\nThe following individual processes were included in the\
  \ product stage A1\u2013A3 of production:\n\nProvision processes concerning preliminary\
  \ products and energy  \nTransporting the raw materials and preliminary materials\
  \ to the plant \nProduction process in the plant including energy inputs, disposal\
  \ of residual materials arising and emissions \nProduction of packagingThe packaging\
  \ material volumes taken into account involve annual consumption / annual purchase\
  \ volumes which also cover pallet returns.\nEmissions and burdens attributable to\
  \ disposal of packaging are allocated to Module A5.\nThe disposal of stone wool\
  \ at the end of life takes into account the transport by truck to a landfill site\
  \ (C2) as well as final landfilling (C4) with utilisation of landfill gas for generating\
  \ electricity.\n\nThe scope of examination for the facings covers the same modules\
  \ that are already declared for the unfaced products. As no additional packaging\
  \ is taken into account for the facing, no environmental burdens or credits result\
  \ in the modules A5 and D for the facings.\n\n# Technology Description And Included\
  \ Processes\n\nStone wool insulation materials are fibre insulation materials. The\
  \ essential components are stone wool thermal insulation fibres, monofilament synthetic\
  \ mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The\
  \ mean fibre diameter is 3-6 \u03BCm. The fibres can be up to several centimetres\
  \ in length. The unfaced and uncoated synthetic resin-bonded stone wool insulation\
  \ materials described in this declaration are produced in the form of slabs, mats\
  \ or rolls in the low bulk density range (up to 60 kg/m\xB3). The products are supplied\
  \ in thicknesses of 20 to 350 mm, e.g. as pressure-resistant slabs, non-crush double-layered\
  \ slabs or highly compressible felts and rolls. Both diabase or basalt and concrete\
  \ blocks are melted using coke in a cupola furnace at approx. 1,400-1,500\xB0C and\
  \ spun into fibres in a roller spinning process. Fluxing agents (mineral oils) and\
  \ binder (urea-modified phenol formaldehyde resin) are then immediately sprayed\
  \ on in an aqueous solutions. The binder serves to ensure bonding and dimensional\
  \ stability while the fluxing agent minimises dust and ensure water repellence.\
  \ The bonding agent also contained in the aqueous solution supports adhesion of\
  \ the binder to the fibres. The raw wool is deposited on conveyer belts in negative-pressure\
  \ collecting chambers. The uncured material is then continuously discharged and\
  \ fed into hardening furnaces in which air at 200-300\xB0C is sucked through the\
  \ wool mass, leading the binders to cross-link to form thermosets. This process\
  \ can be followed by applying facings or the mat is quilted with a wire mesh. However,\
  \ these processes are not addressed in this declaration. Finally, the product is\
  \ shaped by sawing. The waste air volume arising during production is mechanically\
  \ filtered and largely afterburned thermally. The heat content is used for pre-heating\
  \ the blast air by heat exchangers. The dust separated is re-used as a raw material.\
  \ Process water is cleaned internally and largely returned into the process. The\
  \ LCA results cover the life cycle stages of the production of the preliminary products\
  \ including raw material extraction and processing operations of secondary materials\
  \ serving as input (e.g. recycling process), their transports to the plant as well\
  \ as the production itself including the supply of all auxiliaries and consumables\
  \ and energy as well as the whole waste treatment or landfilling of residual waste\
  \ during the production stage. The modules A1, A2 and A3 are shown as an aggregated\
  \ module A1-A3. In addition, the modules A5 (Assembly), C2 (Transport), C4 (Disposal)\
  \ and D (Benefits) are declared. \nTechnical data: \nDeclared value of thermal conductivity\
  \ \u03BBD as per /DIN EN 13162/: 0.032 to 0.048 [W/m\u2219K] \nDesign value of thermal\
  \ conductivity \u03BB as per general construction approval: 0.032 to 0.048 [W/m\u2219\
  K] \nWater vapour diffusion resistance value according to /EN 12086/ \xB5 = 1  \n\
  Water vapour diffusion equivalent air layer thickness = \u03BC x component thickness\
  \ in [m] (this would be 1 for a thickness of 1 m) \nBulk density as per /DIN 1602/:\
  \ \u226460 kg/m\xB3 \nCompressive stress as per /EN 826/: 0.5 to 5 kPa \nSound absorption\
  \ coefficients \u03B1S depending on the frequency as per /DIN EN ISO 354/ are listed\
  \ in the data sheets for the corresponding products, e.g. RAF noise absorption panel\
  \ (30 mm panel with 200 mm air space): \nDeclared unit: \nThis declaration refers\
  \ to the life cycle of 1 m\xB3 of stone wool insulation material produced by Deutsche\
  \ ROCKWOOL Mineralwoll GmbH & Co. OHG. ROCKWOOL products are manufactured in three\
  \ plants, with averages being formed on the basis of the production volumes. The\
  \ plants do not display any differences in technology in the production of stone\
  \ wool. The bulk density of the declared stone wool products ranges from 27 to 60\
  \ kg/m\xB3. The averaging results in an average bulk density of 41 kg/m\xB3 for\
  \ stone wool insulation materials in the low bulk density range for which the following\
  \ LCA results are shown. These results can be applied to other bulk densities by\
  \ means of linear scaling."
