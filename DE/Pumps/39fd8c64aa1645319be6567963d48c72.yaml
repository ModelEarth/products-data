lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe declaration applies to 1 piece of MAGNA3\
  \ Stainless Steel pump. \n\nThe product is produced in Wahlstedt, Germany, and the\
  \ life cycle assessment is based on data collected at the production site. Production\
  \ has been modeled using annual production data from 2021-2022. The declaration\
  \ covers six different types of the MAGNA3 50-40/60/80/100/120 F and MAGNA3 32-120\
  \ F (flanged version). \nSystem boundary: \nSystem boundary \n\nThis EPD is Cradle-To-Grave.\
  \ The system boundaries\n\nof the EPD follow the modular approach in EN 15804. By\
  \ decision no. 20170712-n of the SVR, the modules B3, B4 and B5 are by default declared\
  \ as \"MNR\" (module not relevant).\n\nThe product stage (A1-A3) comprises raw material\
  \ extraction and processing, transport processes as well as the manufacturing process.\
  \ The final production and assembly of the MAGNA3 pump takes place at a Grundfos\
  \ manufacturing site in Germany. However, the full supply-chain leading to the finished\
  \ product at the gate is rather complex and includes a large amount of raw materials,\
  \ components and semi-finished parts which come from both external suppliers as\
  \ well as other Grundfos production facilities\n\nThe product stage is included\
  \ in the study, and according to EN 15804 the system boundary with nature is set\
  \ to include those processes that provide the material and energy inputs into the\
  \ system and the following manufacturing, transport up to the factory gate as well\
  \ as the processing of any waste arising from those processes.\n\nWastes and losses\
  \ are included in the modules where they occur according to the polluter pays principle\
  \ and the modular approach of EN 15804.\n\nThe product includes:\n\n\xB7 A1 Extraction\
  \ and processing of raw materials;\n\n\xB7 A1 Reuse of products or materials from\
  \ a previous product system;\n\n\xB7 A1 Processing of secondary materials;\n\n\xB7\
  \ A1 Generation of electricity, steam and heat from primary energy resources, also\
  \ including their extraction, refining and transport;\n\n\xB7 A1 Energy recovery\
  \ and other recovery processes from secondary fuels;\n\n\xB7 A2 Transportation up\
  \ to the factory gate and internal transport;\n\n\xB7 A3 Production of ancillary\
  \ materials or pre products;\n\n\xB7 A3 Manufacturing of products and coproducts;\n\
  \n\xB7 A3 Manufacturing of packaging;\n\n\xB7 A1-A3 processing up to the end-of-waste\
  \ state or disposal of final residues.\n\nFor secondary material inputs, the system\
  \ boundary to the previous system (providing the secondary material) is set where\
  \ outputs reach the end-of-waste state. The recycling of secondary material into\
  \ new raw materials is included in the system boundary of this study. Waste\n\n\
  materials from production processes that are recycled without any modification of\
  \ the materials inherent characteristics are modelled as closed-loop within A1-A3.\
  \ This is done up to the input mass flow that was used during production.\n\nWaste\
  \ for incineration arising in the product stage is accounted for in the module where\
  \ the waste is produced. The environmental loads from the incineration process are\
  \ declared in the module where it occurs and the electricity and heat which is produced\
  \ from the incineration are considered as closed-loop within A1-A3, as described\
  \ in PCR Part A, 5.5.1. The input of biogenic carbon from the production of packaging\
  \ material is inventoried in A3. As required by PCR Part A, the corresponding end-of-life\
  \ module of the packaging material, A5, is also declared and the emissions of biogenic\
  \ carbon are inventoried.\n\nThe construction process stage (A4-A5) includes:\n\n\
  A4:\n\n\xB7 Transportation from factory gate to the distribution centre:\n\n\xB7\
  \ Consumption of electricity, thermal energy and water at the distribution centre;\n\
  \n\xB7 Transportation from distribution centre to construction site;\n\n\xB7 Wastage\
  \ during distribution.\n\nA5:\n\n\xB7 Installation process;\n\n\xB7 Transport of\
  \ packaging waste to the treatment site;\n\n\xB7 Waste treatment of packaging.\n\
  \nThe packaging material does not reach the end of waste state but is incinerated\
  \ as waste. According to European statistics, the average R1 value of incineration\
  \ plants is > 0.6. Therefore, it is assumed that packaging material is treated thermally\
  \ in an incineration plant with R1 > 0.6. The loads from the combustion process\
  \ of packaging are declared in module A5 and the resulting energy benefits in module\
  \ D, as required by the PCR Part A, 5.5.2.\n\nUse stage (B1-B7):\n\nThe use stage,\
  \ related to the building fabric includes:\n\n\xB7 B1, use or application of the\
  \ installed product;\n\n\xB7 B2, maintenance.\n\nThe use stage related to the operation\
  \ of the building includes:\n\n\xB7 B6, operational energy use;\n\n\xB7 B7, operational\
  \ water use.\n\nIn this study, all use stage modules are assessed, though B1, B2\
  \ and B7 are assessed to be zero. By decision no. 20170712-n of the SVR, the modules\
  \ B3, B4 and B5 are by default declared as \"MNR\" (module not relevant).\nThe modules\
  \ include the provision and transport of all materials, products and related energy\
  \ and water use, as well as waste processing up to the end-of-waste state or disposal\
  \ of final residues during the use stage. They also include all impacts and aspects\
  \ related to the losses during the use stage (i.e. production, transport, waste\
  \ processing and disposal of the lost products and materials).\n\nGenerally, the\
  \ geographical coverage of the datasets used matches the actual processes taking\
  \ place. Meaning, that when modelling taking place in Grundfos Bjerringbro, the\
  \ Danish electricity grid mix is used in the model and thermal energy from natural\
  \ gas. These are generally of very high quality with very good technological, temporal\
  \ and geographical representativeness.\n\nContributions to operational energy use\
  \ during the use stage (B6) come from the electricity consumption of the product.\
  \ The annual electricity consumption is calculated by multiplying the average power\
  \ input, which is based on a defined load profile, with the annual running hours.\
  \ For use stage (B6) European Average electricity grid mix has been used. These\
  \ values are declared in the scenarios section.\n\nThe End-of-Life stage (C1-C4)\
  \ includes all activities from when the product reaches the end of its service life\
  \ and no longer provides any functionality and until all materials and components\
  \ are processed for reuse/recycling or disposed of.\n\nAccording to EN 15804 and\
  \ the PCR Part A, the end-of-life stage includes:\n\n\xB7 C1 deconstruction of the\
  \ product from the building, including initial on-site sorting of the materials;\n\
  \n\xB7 C2 transportation of the discarded product to a recycling site and transportation\
  \ of waste to final disposal;\n\n\xB7 C3 waste processing, collection of waste fractions\
  \ from the deconstruction and waste processing of material flows intended for reuse,\
  \ recycling and energy recovery;\n\n\xB7 C4 waste disposal including physical pretreatment\
  \ and management of the disposal site.\n\nAt end of life, the MAGNA3 pump is manually\
  \ disassembled from the piping system in which it has been installed. The definition\
  \ of the applied end-of-life scenario in this EPD follows the requirements in the\n\
  \nPCR Part A, 6.2 regarding complex products, with a combination of recycling, thermal\
  \ waste treatment and landfilling. 100 % of the material is considered in the end\
  \ of life scenario as required by the PCR. An overall collection rate of 90 % has\
  \ been assumed.\n\nMaterials from which energy is recovered in an incineration process\
  \ with an R1-value above 0.60 are in this study included with the environmental\
  \ burdens from the incineration process inventoried in C3, the recovered energy\
  \ is declared as exported energy in C3 and the energy benefits are declared in D.\
  \ This procedure is according to the PCR Part A, 5.5.6. C3 includes the mechanical\
  \ separation of the product followed by a series of sorting steps. Metal fractions\
  \ are recycled and plastics, cardboard and electronics are assumed incinerated with\
  \ energy recovery. The residual fractions are landfilled and declared in C4.\n\n\
  The specific amounts are shown in the scenarios section.\n\nBeyond system boundary\
  \ (D): According to EN 15804 module D includes the reuse, recovery and/or recycling\
  \ potentials, expressed as net impacts and benefits. Any declared benefits and loads\
  \ from net flows leaving the product system that have not been allocated as co-products\
  \ and that have passed the end-of waste state are included in module D.\n\nContributions\
  \ to module D comes from waste incineration processes in A5 and C3 as well as material\
  \ recycling in C3. The specific fractions and net flows are shown in the scenarios\
  \ section.\n\nComparability\n\nBasically, a comparison or an evaluation of EPD data\
  \ is only possible if all the data sets to be compared were created according to\
  \ EN 15804 and the building context, respectively the product-specific characteristics\
  \ of performance, are taken into account.\n\n# Technology Description And Included\
  \ Processes\n\nThe production of the MAGNA3 is divided into several areas. These\
  \ areas are supplied with materials coming from our internal \u2013 and external\
  \ supply chain. Mechanics: The mechanics area is divided into three subareas. -\
  \ Mechanical production of components such as impellers, bearing plates and stators.\
  \ These are manufactured by e.g. Molding, machining, stamping and winding operations\
  \ - Motor production: In this area the stator is wound and the rotor is magnetized,\
  \ and then assembled. - Final assembly: The components from the mechanical area,\
  \ electronics area and purchased components are assembled in to final product. Furthermore\
  \ this is also the area where testing is conducted, and the final product is packaged\
  \ for delivery. Electronics: PCB's (Printed circuit board) are delivered from the\
  \ supplier. These are then assembled by SMT (Surface Mounted Technology). Then the\
  \ PCB is depanelled and moved to the THT (through Hole Technology) before entering\
  \ final assembly. The final product is control box complete. \nTechnical data: \n\
  The performance data of the product according to the harmonised norms, based on\
  \ the harmonisation provisions above apply.\nThe relevant technical specifications\
  \ according to the PCR Part B are given in the table below.\nCharacteristics that\
  \ are the same for all three product groups are only given once. Others are given\
  \ individually for all three groups. \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared unit is 1 piece\
  \ (pcs.) of MAGNA3 Stainless Steel pump."
