  ## Product Component Notes

  Declared unit 1 piece of mechanical panic exit device Mass 8.78 kg Conversion factor
  to 1 kg 0.114 - 3.2 System boundary Type of the EPD: cradle to gate - with Options
  The following life cycle phases were considered: Production stage: A1 - Raw material
  extraction and processing A2 - Transport to the manufacturer and A3 - Manufacturing
  Construction stage: A4 - Transport from the gate to the site A5 - Packaging waste
  processing The use stage: B2 - Maintenance (cleaning of the exit device) End-of-life
  stage: C2 - Transport to waste processing C4 - Disposal (landfill) This includes
  provision of all materials, products and energy, packaging processing and its transport,
  as well as waste processing up to the end-of waste state or disposal of final residues.
  D - Declaration of all benefits or recycling potential from EOL and A5. 3.3 Estimates
  and assumptions EoL: In the End-of-Life phase, for all the materials which can be
  recycled, a recycling scenario with 100% collection rate was assumed. 3.4 Cut-off
  criteria In the assessment, all available data from the production process are considered,
  i.e. all raw materials used, auxiliary materials (e.g. lubricants), thermal energy
  consumption and electric power consumption - including material and energy flows
  contributing less than 1% of mass or energy (if available). In case a specific flow
  contributing less than 1% in mass or energy is not available, worst case assumption
  proxies are selected to represent the respective environmental impacts. Impacts
  relating to the production of machines and facilities required during production
  are out of the scope of this assessment. 3.5 Background data For life cycle modeling
  of the considered products, the GaBi 6 Software System for Life Cycle Engineering,
  developed by PE INTERNATIONAL AG, is used /GaBi 6 2013/. The GaBi-database contains
  consistent and documented datasets which are documented in the online GaBi-documentation
  /GaBi 6 2013D/. To ensure comparability of results in the LCA, the basic data of
  GaBi database were used for energy, transportation and auxiliary materials. 3.6
  Data quality The requirements for data quality and background data correspond to
  the specifications of the /IBU PCR PART A/. PE INTERNATIONAL performed a variety
  of tests and validations during the commission of the present study in order to
  ensure its quality of the present document and results. This obviously includes
  an extensive review of project-specific LCA models as well as the background data
  used. The technological background of the collected data reflects the physical reality
  of the declared products. The datasets are complete and conform to the system boundaries
  and the criteria for the exclusion of inputs and outputs. All relevant background
  datasets are taken from the GaBi 6 software database. The last revision of the used
  background data has taken place not longer than 10 years ago. 3.7 Period under review
  The period under review is 2013/14 (12 month average). 3.8 Allocation Regarding
  incineration, the software model for the waste incineration plant (WIP) is adapted
  according to the material composition and heating value of the 5 Environmental Product
  Declaration SARGENT Manufacturing Company - 80 Series mechanical panic exit device
  combusted material. In this EPD, the following specific life cycle inventories for
  the WIP are considered for: Waste incineration of plastic Waste incineration of
  paper Regarding the recycling material of metals, the metal parts in the EoL are
  declared as end-of-waste status. Thus, these materials are considered in module
  D. Specific information on allocation within the background data is given in the
  GaBi dataset documentation. 3.9 Comparability Basically, a comparison or an evaluation
  of EPD data is only possible if all the data sets to be compared were created according
  to /EN 15804/ and the building context, respectively the product-specific characteristics
  of performance, are taken into account. 4. LCA: Scenarios and addit'
