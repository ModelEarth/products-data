lca_discussion: "\n\n## Product Component Notes\nThe primary product components and/or\
  \ materials must be indicated as a percentage mass to enable the user of the EPD\
  \ to understand the composition of the product in delivery status. The average composition\
  \ for the M3 CLIQ mortise cylinder is as follows: Material Percentage in mass (%)\
  \ Brass 94.91% Stainless Steel 1.69% Steel 2.43% Electronics 0.26% Electromechanics\
  \ 0.45% Plastics 0.26% Other 0.00% Total 100.00%\n\n## LCA Notes\nThis is a cradle\
  \ to gate with options Environmental Product Declaration. The following life cycle\
  \ phases were considered: Benefits and Construction Loads Beyond Product Stage Use\
  \ Stage End of Life Stage* Process Stage the System Boundaries Deconstruction gate\
  \ to the site Transport from Refurbishment Manufacturing Construction/ Replacement\

  \ Declared) *This includes provision of all materials, products and energy, packaging\
  \ processing and its transport, as well as waste processing up to the end of waste\
  \ state or disposal of final residues.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nused are complete\
  \ and representative of North America in terms of the geographic and technological\
  \ coverage and are a recent vintage (i.e. less than ten years old). The data used\
  \ for primary data are based on direct information sources of the manufacturer.\
  \ Secondary data sets were used for raw materials extraction and processing, end\
  \ of life, transportation, and energy production flows. Wherever secondary data\
  \ is used, the study adopts critically reviewed data for consistency, precision,\
  \ and reproducibility to limit uncertainty. Period Under Review The period under\
  \ review is the full calendar year of 2014. Allocation The Salem facility produces\
  \ a variety of smaller components in addition to the cylinder locks, so allocation\
  \ was conducted based on a weighting derived from process engineers at Medeco. 90%\
  \ of plant energy and overhead was estimated to apply to the production of cylinders\
  \ while the remaining 10% was allocated to keys and other smaller parts. Comparability\
  \ A comparison or an evaluation of EPD data is only possible if all data sets to\
  \ be compared were created according to EN 15804 and the building context, respectively\
  \ the product-specific characteristics of performance, are taken into account. Environmental\
  \ delarations from different programs may not be comparable. Full conformance with\
  \ the PCR for North American Builders Hardware products allows EPD comparability\
  \ only when all stages of a Builders Hardware product's life cycle have been considered.\
  \ However, variations and deviations are possible. LCA: Modeling Scenarios and Additional\
  \ Technical Information The following technical information is a basis for the declared\
  \ modules or can be used for developing specific scenarios in the context of a building\
  \ assessment if modules are not declared. Installation into the building (A5) Reference\

  \ The production (A1-A3) life cycle stage drives the results in all of the environmental\
  \ impact categories. Manufacturing impacts (A3) are primarily driven by electricity\
  \ use. Brass and steel drive the production stage (A1), as these materials are the\
  \ primary materials within the product. Transportation impacts (A2) have a negligble\
  \ impact within the production stage. References - PCR Part A UL Environment and\
