description: /Product definition EGGER Laminate is a versatile material which is processed
  in combination with classic wood-based materials such as MDF (medium density fibreboard),
  HDF (high density fibreboard) and chipboard or other core materials to form so-called
  laminate composite elements. Traditional applications and areas in which they can
  be used include the kitchen and door industries, the office furniture sector, exhibition
  stand construction, shopfitting, interior design and the shipbuilding and automotive
  industries. Laminates consist of paper webs, impregnated with heat-setting resins.
  They have a multilayer structure and consist of melamine resin impregnated decorative
  paper and one or more layers of soda kraft paper impregnated with phenolic resins,
  which are laminated under high pressure and heat. The laminate structure, the resin
  and paper quality, the surface texture, the use of special overlays and the press
  parameters during production determine the laminate quality and therefore the subsequent
  use or area of application. The respective national regulations at the place of
  use apply to the use of the product, in Germany for example the building regulations
  of the federal states, and the technical directives based on these regulations.

lca_discussion: "\n\n## Product Component Notes\nPaper percentage 57 % Resin percentage\
  \ 42 % Additive 1 % EGGER laminates consist of: - decor paper (50 - 25 g/m\xB2)\
  \ - soda kraft paper (60 - 150 g/m\xB2) - backing paper (50 - 100 g/m\xB2) - overlay\
  \ paper (20 - 25 g/m\xB2) - melamine-formaldehyde resin - phenol-formaldehyde resin\
  \ The product EGGER Laminate contains substances on the ECHA List of substances\
  \ of very high concern (date 30.10.2020) above 0.1% by weight: no. The product EGGER\
  \ laminate contains other CMR substances of category 1A or 1B that are not on the\
  \ candidate list, above 0.1 by weight % in at least one sub-product: no. Biocidal\
  \ products have been added to this building product EGGER Laminate or it has been\
  \ treated with biocidal products (this refers to treated goods within the meaning\
  \ of the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012): no. 2.6 Manufacture EGGER\
  \ laminates are only produced using a continuous process. Dual-belt presses allow\
  \ the continuous production of various laminate thicknesses and grades. This grade\
  \ or type of laminate production is generally known as CPL (Continuous Pressed Laminate).\
  \ Depending on the pressure during production, EGGER laminates are produced in accordance\
  \ with or based on EN 438-3. The laminates consist of layers of cellulose fibre\
  \ webs (usually paper) that are impregnated with curable resins. The one-sided outer\
  \ layer(s) with decorative colours or patterns is (are) impregnated with melamine-based\
  \ resins. The core layers are impregnated with phenolic resins. Applying heat and\
  \ pressure causes the resins to flow and subsequently cure. Cross-linking of the\
  \ resins, reinforced by the cellulose fibres of the papers, results in a very dense\
  \ material with a sealed surface. 2.7 Environment and health during manufacturing\
  \ EGGER Gifhorn is certified according to ISO 45001 \"Management systems for safety\
  \ and health at work\". The standard ISO 45001 imposes requirements on the company\
  \ in order to align the processes for sustainable improvement in occupational health\
  \ and safety. The manufacturing plant is also certified in line with the international\
  \ environmental standard ISO 14001. The management system includes the continuous\
  \ improvement of the environmental performance assessment, the continuous reduction\
  \ of environmental risks, as well as the implementation of environmental protection\
  \ measures. Due to the manufacturing conditions no measures for health protection\
  \ are necessary over and above the legislative and other regulations. Values in\
  \ all areas of the plant are significantly below the maximum allowable concentration\
  \ according to GefStoffV. Air: Exhaust air from the production process is cleaned\
  \ in accordance with the applicable legal regulations. Emissions are significantly\
  \ below the TG Air (Technical Guideline for Keeping Air Clean). Water/ground: There\
  \ is no contamination of water or the ground. Waste water from the production process\
  \ is fed into the sewer system. Noise protection measurements showed that all the\
  \ values determined within and outside of the production plant were far below the\
  \ minimum requirements applicable for Germany. Sections of the plant where high\
  \ noise levels are produced have been shielded by suitable construction measures."
