description: "/Product definition EGGER Laminate Flammex is a versatile decorative\
  \ material which is processed in combination with classic wood-based materials such\
  \ as MDF (medium density fibreboard), HDF (high density fibreboard) and chipboard\
  \ or other core materials to form so-called laminate composite elements. Laminates\
  \ consist of paper webs, impregnated with heat-setting resins. They have a multiple\
  \ layer structure, which consists of a decorative melamine resin impregnated paper\
  \ and one or more phenolic resin impregnated kraft core paper. These papers are\
  \ then pressed together under high pressure and heat. The laminate quality Flammex\
  \ can be classified according to the \xD6NORM EN 438-1 as laminate type F - flame-retardant.\
  \ In case of fire, the Laminate Flammex meets the special requirements of building\
  \ materials class B1 per DIN 4102-1 and the French fire behaviour category M1 per\
  \ NF P 92-501. The laminate structure, the resin and paper quality, the surface\
  \ texture, the use of special overlays and the press parameters during production\
  \ determine the laminate 2 quality and therefore the subsequent use or area of application.\
  \ The declared product is an area-weighted average of the various EGGER products\
  \ in this product family. The respective national regulations at the place of use\
  \ apply to the use of the product, in Germany for example the building regulations\
  \ of the federal states, and the technical directives based on these regulations."

lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nPaper content 62 % Resin content 37 %\
  \ Additive 1 % EGGER Laminates Flammex consist of: - decor paper (50 - 25 g/m\xB2\
  ) - soda kraft paper (60 - 150 g/m\xB2) - backing paper (50 - 100 g/m\xB2) - overlay\
  \ paper (20 - 25 g/m\xB2) - melamine-formaldehyde resin - phenol-formaldehyde resin\
  \ The product contains substances on the ECHA List of substances of very high concern\
  \ - SVHC (date 25.06.2020) above 0.1% by weight: no. The product contains other\
  \ CMR substances of category 1A or 1B that are not on the candidate list, above\
  \ 0.1 by weight % in at least one sub-product: no. Biocidal products have been added\
  \ to this building product or it has been treated with biocidal products (this refers\
  \ to treated goods within the meaning of the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No.\
  \ 528/2012): no. 2.6 Manufacture EGGER laminates are only produced using a continuous\
  \ process. Dual-belt presses allow the continuous production of various laminate\
  \ thicknesses and grades. This grade or type of laminate production is generally\
  \ known as CPL (Continuous Pressed Laminates). Depending on the pressure during\
  \ production, EGGER laminates are produced in accordance with or based on EN 438-3.\
  \ The laminates consist of layers of cellulose fibre webs (usually paper) that are\
  \ impregnated with curable resins. The one-sided outer layer(s) with decorative\
  \ colours or patterns is (are) impregnated with melamine-based resins. The core\
  \ layers are impregnated with phenolic resins. Applying heat and pressure causes\
  \ the resins to flow and subsequently cure. Cross-linking of the resins, reinforced\
  \ by the cellulose fibres of the papers, results in a very dense material with a\
  \ sealed surface. 2.7 Environment and health during manufacturing EGGER Gifhorn\
  \ is certified according to ISO 45001 \"Management systems for safety and health\
  \ at work\". The standard ISO 45001 imposes requirements on the company in order\
  \ to align the processes for sustainable improvement in occupational health and\
  \ safety. The manufacturing plant is certified in line with the international environmental\
  \ standard ISO 14001. The management system includes the continuous improvement\
  \ of the ecobalance, the continuous reduction of environmental crises, as well as\
  \ the implementation of environmental protection measures. Due to the manufacturing\
  \ conditions no measures for health protection are necessary over and above the\
  \ legislative and other regulations. Values are well below the OEL (occupational\
  \ exposure limits) according to the Ordinance on Hazardous Substances (Germany)\
  \ in all areas of the plant. Air: The exhaust air that is created in relation to\
  \ the product is purified according to the legislative regulations. Emissions are\
  \ significantly below the TG Air (Technical Guideline for Keeping Air Clean). Water/soil:\
  \ There is no impact on water or soil. Waste water from the production process is\
  \ cleaned internally and fed into the sewer system. Noise protection measurements\
  \ showed that all the values determined within and outside of the production plant\
  \ were far below the minimum requirements applicable for Germany. Sections of the\
  \ plant where high noise levels are produced have been shielded by suitable construction\
  \ measures. 2.8 Product processing/Installation The product is used for the lamination\
  \ of classical wood-based materials, such as MDF (medium density fibreboard), HDF\
  \ (high density fibreboard) and chipboard. It may be processed with conventional\
  \ urea-formaldehyde resin glue and dispersion glue in presses (flat, short cycle\
  \ and dual-belt presses) using the hot or cold process."
