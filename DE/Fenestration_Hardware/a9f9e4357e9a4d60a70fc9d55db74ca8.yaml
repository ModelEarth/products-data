description: 'The declared product is a gate valve for drinking water supply according
  to EN 1074-1 and EN 1074-2 with the trade name Hawle E3, specifically the version
  DN100 PN16 SHORT. The product is installed in the pipeline network via flange connections
  and is used to open or shut off the water flow. Catalog number: 4000E3 Internal
  material number: 5001482 Goods no. / Imp. code no.: 84818061 EAN/UPC code: 9007878121296
  Coating standard: EN 14901 The gate valve is designed as a resilient seated wedge-type
  gate valve with a smooth and free bore. The body has a two-part design: the bottom
  part is connected to the pipeline via flanges. Optionally, supports, spigots or
  other connection systems (System2000, VRS) may also be used. The top part (the bonnet)
  houses the spindle and the sealing wedge. The top and bottom part are connected
  with stainless steel screws and an elastomer gasket. The bonnet and the body are
  made from EN-GJS-400-15 ductile cast iron pursuant to EN 1563. They are epoxy powder
  coated on the inside and outside pursuant to DIN 3476-1 and in compliance with the
  quality and testing provisions of RAL-GZ 662. The sealing wedge is vulcanized over
  its entire surface. A wedge nut is connected flexibly, without any clearance, and
  such that it absorbs vibrations, by way of positive locking and elastomer embedding.
  The inside of the wedge is made from EN-GJS-400 ductile cast iron pursuant to EN
  1563, while the outside of the wedge is fully rubberized with vulcanized EPDM (vulcanised
  ethylene propylene-diene rubber, according to EN 681-1). The wedge guide has a plastic
  top piece. The Duplex stainless-steel spindle (Duplex 1.4162 (pitting-resistence-equivalent-number
  (PRE number) ~26)) rounds out the load-optimized design and guarantees ultra-low
  wear, minimal closure torques, and optimum corrosion resistance. An O-ring carrier
  and a spindle support seal the spindle and ensure easy movement of the sealing wedge.
  The flange openings are closed with covering c...'

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis Environmental Product Declaration refers\
  \ to a declared unit of 1 piece E3 valve - type DN100 PN16 SHORT - produced at the\
  \ production sites of E. Hawle Armaturenwerke GmbH in Vcklabruck and Frankenmarkt\
  \ (Austria). \nSystem boundary: \nThe life cycle assessment of E3 valves refers\
  \ to a cradle-to-gate analysis with modules C1\u2013C4\nand module D (A1\u2013A3\
  \ + C + D). The following life cycle phases are part of the analysis.\n\nModule\
  \ A1\u2013A3 | Production stage\n\nThe production stage includes the upstream burdens\
  \ of raw material supply, their transports and the production of E3 valves at E.\
  \ Hawle Armaturenwerke GmbH in Vcklabruck and Frankenmarkt. The production sites\
  \ are supplied with electricity from hydropower (emission factor GWP total: 6,4\
  \ g\nCO2-equivalents/kWh). The provision of thermal energy at the site in Vcklabruck\
  \ is based on district heating using natural gas and biomass. Thermal energy supply\
  \ in Frankenmarkt is based on local heating using biomass. The production of the\
  \ product packaging is also included in module A1\u2013A3.\n\nModule C1 | Deconstruction\
  \ and demolition\n\nThe product is used underground and is either dismounted from\
  \ the accompanying structures and used in steel production or the valves may remain\
  \ in the ground after their service life. In the case of removal, the whole valves\
  \ are used as secondary material in the steel production. The disposal without disassembly\
  \ of the product is considered as representative for the end-of-life scenario. Burdens\
  \ associated with the dismounting of the products are assumed as low. The real energy\
  \ consumption of dismounting strongly depends on the site-specific conditions.\n\
  \nModule C2 | Transport to disposal\n\nThe transport to the disposal of the material\
  \ is estimated declaring a 50 km radius to the waste processing.\n\nModule C3 |\
  \ Waste processing\n\nProduct flows that reach Module D for recycling reach the\
  \ end-of-waste state in C3 and thus leave the product system. Environmental impacts\
  \ resulting from the sorting of metal scrap are not included, as referring energy\
  \ demand is considered to be negligible.\n\nModule C4 | Disposal\n\nModule C4 refers\
  \ to the emissions from the disposal of the losses from waste processing. Since\
  \ the chosen scenario assumes the recycling of 100 % of the product, no environmental\
  \ burdens are declared in module C4.\n\nModule D | Benefits and loads beyond the\
  \ system boundary\n\nModule D declares the recycling of the recovered metals (100\
  \ % share) including the environmental potential for substituting primary material.\n\
  \n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nThe gate valve is manufactured\
  \ in accordance with the quality management standard ISO 9001. All products are\
  \ checked for function and tightness prior to dispatch. Production takes place according\
  \ to the specifications of the relevant standards. The products and the manufacturing\
  \ methods also meet the requirements of the country-specific approvals. Production\
  \ takes place at the two production sites of E. Hawle Armaturenwerke GmbH in V\xF6\
  cklabruck and Frankenmarkt. The body components are processed mechanically; the\
  \ surfaces are blasted and then epoxy powder coated. The spindles are produced from\
  \ Duplex rod material that is swaged externally. The swaged part is processed mechanically\
  \ at Hawle and the thread is rolled. Various plastic components are produced using\
  \ injection molding machines: sliding disk made from POM granules (polyoxymethylene),\
  \ covering cap/edge protection made from PEHD granules (high-density-polyethylene),\
  \ wedge guide made from POM-C granules. The sealing wedge is first punched and blasted.\
  \ The wedge and wedge nut are coated with adhesion promoter and are then vulcanized\
  \ with rubber. The bonnet gasket is made from raw rubber in elastomer production.\
  \ Various O-rings are bought in. The individual components are assembled and are\
  \ finished after passing the functional and pressure testing. \nDeclared unit: \n\
  This environmental product declaration refers to a declared unit of 1 piece E3 valve\
  \ - type DN100 PN16 SHORT - with a weight of 20.5 kg/piece."
