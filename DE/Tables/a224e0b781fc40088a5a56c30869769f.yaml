description: S Ad Hoc The Ad Hoc office furniture system was designed in collaboration
  with Antonio Citterio in 1994 and has been continuously updated and expanded ever
  since. It is both an archetype and a classic in the area of office furniture systems.
  The functional longevity and economic efficiency of Ad Hoc are due to its adaptability,
  high-quality materials and superior workmanship, as well as its timeless expression
  of technological elegance. Click The recessed folding device also allows for space-saving
  storage. Up to ten tables can be stacked on the trolley. Click is available in three
  sizes as well as in a practical set of ten tables with a stacking trolley. The Click
  model represented by this EPD is described in Table 1. Eames Table For decades,
  meetings and conferences have been held around the Segmented Tables designed by
  Charles and Ray Eames. And the relevance of these tables continues to increase as
  teamwork and communication play an ever greater role at work. The Eames Segmented
  Tables come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials. The Eames Table represented
  by this EPD is described in Table 1. The Vitra Ad Hoc, Click, and Eames tables are
  manufactured in an ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 production facility. PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS

lca_discussion: "## Source Data Notes\nDisclaimers: This EPD conforms to ISO 14025,\
  \ 14040, and ISO 14044. Scope of Results Reported: The PCR requirements limit the\
  \ scope of the LCA metrics such that the results exclude environmental and social\
  \ performance benchmarks and thresholds, and exclude impacts from the depletion\
  \ of natural resources, land use ecological impacts, ocean impacts related to greenhouse\
  \ gas emissions, risks from hazardous wastes and impacts linked to hazardous chemical\
  \ emissions. Accuracy of Results: Due to PCR constraints, this EPD provides estimations\
  \ of potential impacts that are inherently limited in terms of accuracy. Comparability:\
  \ The PCR this EPD was based on was not written to support comparative assertions.\
  \ EPDs based on different PCRs, or different calculation models, may not be comparable.\
  \ When attempting to compare EPDs or life cycle impacts of products from different\
  \ companies, the user should be aware of the uncertainty in the final results, due\
  \ to and not limited to, the practitioner\u2019s assumptions, the source of the\
  \ data used in the study, and the specifics of the product modeled. PCR review,\
  \ was conducted by"
