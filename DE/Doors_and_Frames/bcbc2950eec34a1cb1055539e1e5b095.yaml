description: 'The automatic swing door operators manufactured by DORMA are electromechanical
  swing door operators designed for single- or double-leaf swing doors. Depending
  on the width and weight of the door leaf, the ED 100 or the ED 250 is required.
  Both operators can be mounted with standard arm as push-version and with sliding
  channel as pull-version. Apart from the extended cover, an integrated door coordinator
  is also available for double-leaf operators, which is also easily fitted. By using
  the DORMA Upgrade Card, the functional scope can be adapted to a variety of door
  situations. Flexible configuration of the functions actually required Inexpensive
  transport and easy assembly thanks to lower weights Low-noise application thanks
  to multi-stage gear

  Elegant design: DORMA Contur Design with an operator height of only 70 mm The two
  ED 100 and ED 250 variants are particularly distinguished by their drive units.
  For this reason, the ED 250 was taken into consideration in the analysis (maximum
  characteristics of a swing door operator). Only formation of the average for energy
  consumption during the usage phase follows the arithmetic average. Using this conservative
  implementation method, the LCA results are indicated as averages for both swing
  door operators (ED100 / 250).'

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis EPD refers to the calculated average\
  \ of DORMA ED 100 and ED 250 swing door operators. Deviations by the individual\
  \ products from the calculated average are significantly below 10 %. The production\
  \ location for both products is DORMA Ennepetal, Germany. The material and energy\
  \ flows were taken into consideration accordingly. \nSystem boundary: \nType of\
  \ EPD: cradle to gate with options.\n\n\nModules A1-3, A4 and A5\n\nThe product\
  \ stage commences with consideration of the material and energy flows required for\
  \ manufacturing the product, including all of the associated upstream chains and\
  \ requisite transport associated with procurement. Furthermore the whole production\
  \ phase was mapped, including the treatment of production waste towards achieving\
  \ the End-of-Waste status (EoW). Distribution transports and the installation into\
  \ the building were considered as well.\n\n\nModule B6 \n\nAverage energy consumption\
  \ for the two ED 100 and ED 250 automatic swing door operators in Full-Energy Mode\
  \ is depicted using the arithmetic average over the entire operating life time of\
  \ 10 years.\n\n\nModules C2-3 \n\nThe modules include the environmental impacts\
  \ of waste treatment at the end of the product life cycle as well as the transport\
  \ associated with this.\n\n\nModule D \n\nEvidence of credits incurred by waste\
  \ treatment as a result of energetic (MVA route) or material recycling (recycling\
  \ route) of packaging (A5) and the product at the End-of-Life (C3).\n\n# Technology\
  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nThe automatic swing door operators manufactured\
  \ by DORMA are electromechanical swing door operators designed for single- or double-leaf\
  \ swing doors. Depending on the width and weight of the door leaf, the ED 100 or\
  \ the ED 250 is required. Both operators can be mounted with standard arm as push-version\
  \ and with sliding channel as pull-version. Apart from the extended cover, an integrated\

  \ DORMA Contur Design with an operator height of only 70 mm The two ED 100 and ED\

  \ implementation method, the LCA results are indicated as averages for both swing\
  \ door operators (ED100 / 250). The ED 100 and ED 250 swing door operators each\
  \ comprise a swing door operator, a slide channel set and a cover made of high-quality\
  \ aluminium. The individual components made of steel and nonferrous metals are largely\
  \ manufactured in the Ennepetal plant. Electronic components are selfproduced (incl.\
  \ circuit boards) and bought in externally (incl. drive motors). During assembly,\
  \ the swing door operator, the slide channel sets and covers are assembled, packaged\
  \ and stored separately. The certified Quality Management System in accordance with\
  \ /ISO 9001/ ensures the high quality standard of the DORMA products for all production\
  \ sites. \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared unit is the average for one (1) ED 100\
  \ and ED 250 automatic swing door operator, incl. ED slide channel set, ED BASIC\
  \ cover and packaging materials. For the calculation of the average the arithmetic\
  \ mean was used."
