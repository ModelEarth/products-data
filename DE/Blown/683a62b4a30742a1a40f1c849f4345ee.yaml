description: "The JetSpray System from Knauf Insulation is a complete blowing wool\
  \ insulation solution, thermal and acoustical, specially designed and formulated\
  \ for car parks and the crawl spaces under buildings. The System is composed of\
  \ three components. The first component is the JetSpray Primer used to pretreat\
  \ concrete surfaces. The Primer is applied using a paint gun. The second component\
  \ the JetSpray Thermal blowing wool is available in the form of loose-fill flocks,\
  \ having a wooly consistency, compressed and packaged in bags. In terms of composition,\
  \ blowing wool consists of about \u2265 99% inert material. The inert part is made\
  \ of recycled glass (external cullet, up to 80% of the composition), sand and limestone.\
  \ The remaining fraction is made of antistatic and anti-dust compounds. The additive\
  \ content is typically about 0.5 % in weight. The third component the JetSpray Fix\
  \ organic binder is mixed with water to provide a strong adhesion. It then dries\
  \ naturally. After the treatment with JetSpray Primer, the surfaces are sprayed\
  \ with a dedicated blowing machine with a mixture of JetSpray Thermal mineral blowing\
  \ wool and JetSpray Fix organic binder to complete the insulation process. The target\
  \ installed density of the complete JetSpray System is 52 kg/m\xB3. 2 For the placing\
  \ on the market of construction products in the European Union and EFTA (with the\
  \ exception of Switzerland) /Regulation (EU) No 305/2011/ applies. Application Main\
  \ applications for the JetSpray System are insulation of ceilings of car parks and\
  \ crawl spaces under buildings. For the application and use national regulations\
  \ apply."

lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nThe declared unit is 1 m\xB3 of JetSpray\
  \ System. The density used for the calculation of the LCA is 52 kg/m\xB3. Declared\
  \ unit Name Value Unit Declared unit 1 m3 Gross density 52 kg/m3 Conversion factor\
  \ to 1 kg 0.0192 - System boundary The system boundary of the EPD follows the modular\
  \ approach defined by /EN 15804/. The type of EPD is cradle to gate - with options.\
  \ List and explanation of the modules declared in the EPD. The product stage (A1-A3)\
  \ includes: - A1 - raw material extraction and processing, processing of secondary\
  \ material input (e.g. recycling processes), - A2 - transport to the manufacturer\
  \ and - A3 - manufacturing. This includes provision of all materials, products and\
  \ energy, packaging processing and their transport, as well as waste processing\
  \ up to the end-of waste stage or disposal of final residues during the product\
  \ stage. The LCA results are given in an aggregated form for the product stage,\
  \ meaning that the modules A1, A2 and A3 are considered as a unique module A1-A3.\
  \ The construction process stage includes: - A4 - transport to the construction\
  \ site and - A5 - installation into the building. The transport to the building\
  \ site (A4) is included in the LCA calculation. For JetSpray System, the average\
  \ transport distance is assumed to be 600 km with a truck capacity utilization of\
  \ 70%. Module A5 has been included into this EPD as the blowing and spraying equipments\
  \ request electricity to blow and spray the components. The treatment of the packaging\
  \ waste after the installation of the product has also been considered. The product\
  \ losses during the construction process have been taken into account into the LCA\
  \ and represents maximum 2%. The use stage. Because they are specific for the building,\
  \ its use and location, none of the modules related to the building fabric (B1-B5)\
  \ nor the operation of the building (B6 and B7) have been taken into account in\
  \ this EPD. The end-of-life stage includes: - C1 - de-construction, demolition,\
  \ - C2 - transport to waste processing, - C3 - waste processing for reuse, recovery\
  \ and/or recycling and - C4 - disposal. This includes provision of all transports,\
  \ materials, products and related energy and water use, but only modules C2 and\
  \ C4 are reported, as they are considered the most relevant scenarios for glass\
  \ mineral wool products. Although mineral wool products from Knauf Insulation are\
  \ partly recycled at end-of-life, there is not yet an established collection system\
  \ and as such the assumption chosen in this study,100% landfilled after the use\
  \ phase, is the most conservative approach. Module D includes re-use, recovery and/or\
  \ recycling potentials. According to /EN 15804/, any declared benefits and loads\
  \ from net flows leaving the product system not allocated as co-products and having\
  \ passed the end-of waste state shall be included in module D. Benefits from packaging's\
  \ incineration with energy recovery are considered in module D. Comparability Basically,\
  \ a comparison or an evaluation of EPD data is only possible if all the data sets\
  \ to be compared were created according to /EN 15804/ and the building context,\
  \ respectively the product-specific characteristics of performance, are taken into\
  \ account."
