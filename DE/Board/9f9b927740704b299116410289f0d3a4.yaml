lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nStiferite produces STIFERITE ISOCANALE A6B\
  \ that is a high-performance insulation board manufactured from closed cell expanded\
  \ rigid polyurethane foam, covered on both sides by embossed antibacterial aluminum\
  \ of 60 my thickness. The data have been provided by the only Stiferite factory\
  \ that were located in Padova (Italy) for the year 2015. \nSystem boundary: \nThis\
  \ life cycle assessment for the production of the polyurethane insulation board\
  \ considers the life cycle from the supply of raw materials to the manufacturer\xB4\
  s gate (cradle-to-gate with options). It also includes the transport to the construction\
  \ site, the installation and the end-of-life stage of the used PU thermal insulation\
  \ board. The life cycle is split into the following individual phases:\nA1 - Raw\
  \ material formulation \nA2 - Raw material transport\nA3 - Production of the insulation\
  \ board and packaging material\nA4 - Transport to the construction site\nA5 - Emissions\
  \ and cutting losses during installation and packaging disposal\nC2 - Transport\
  \ to end of life\nC3/C4 - End-of-Life: waste management (thermal recovery, landfill)\n\
  D - Benefits and loads beyond system boundary\n\n# Technology Description And Included\
  \ Processes\n\nSTIFERITE\u2019s thermoinsulation panels are mainly used in the building/construction\
  \ sector and that of industrial insulation. The panels are made of thermo-setting\
  \ closed cells polyurethane foam (PU) supplied with various types of flexible facers\
  \ on both sides of the panel. The nature/type of facer contributes to the performance\
  \ characteristics of the product and its application. Expanded rigid polyurethane\
  \ foam is distinguished by its good thermo insulation performance, mechanical resistance,\
  \ workability, lightness, and durability. The performance of STIFERITE\u2019s panels\
  \ is determined based on the European norm EN 13165:2012+A2:2016 Thermal insulation\
  \ products for buildings - Factory made rigid polyurethane foam (PU) products -\
  \ Specification. This EPD refers to STIFERITE\u2019s ISOCANALE A6B average thickness\
  \ panel, made of an insulation component in polyurethane foam using blowing agent\
  \ Pentane-based, covered on both sides by embossed antibacterial aluminum of 60\
  \ \xB5m thickness. The panel is produced with the standard dimensions of 1200 x\
  \ 4000 mm and with straight finished edges. Upon request and for minimum quantities,\
  \ the panels may be produced in various dimensions. STIFERITE ISOCANALE A6B panel\
  \ is produced by a certified company with systems: ISO 9001, OHSAS 45001, ISO 14001\
  \ in its entire line of products. The STIFERITE ISOCANALE A6B panel is suited for\
  \ the construction of pre-insulated heating and ventilation ducts. \nTechnical data:\
  \ \nFor the insulation products the data of their Declaration of Performance (DoP)\
  \ apply. In this Life Cycle Assessment, a PU insulation board with the following\
  \ properties has been regarded: \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared unit is 1 m\xB2\
  \ with with an average thickness of 20 mm, e. g. 0.02 m\xB3. Corresponding conversion\
  \ factors are listed in the table below."
