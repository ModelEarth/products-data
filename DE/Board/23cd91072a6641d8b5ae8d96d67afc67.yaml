lca_discussion: '## Product Component Notes

  Coniferous wood: fir / spruce ca. 94,5 %

  PUR resin max. 4,0 %

  Paraffin max. 1,5 %

  2.6 Manufacture

  The manufacturing process is broken down into the

  following process steps:

  1. Delivering the wood chips

  2. Defibering the wood chips using the defibrator

  process

  3. Hydrophobing the fibres with paraffin

  4. Drying the fibres with PUR resin

  5. Glueing the fibres with PUR resin

  6. Scattering the fibres on the forming belt to form a

  mat

  7. Curing the mat in the calibration and hardening unit

  8. Dividing up, profiling and assembling

  The location is certified to /DIN EN ISO 9001:2008/.

  2.7 Environment and health during

  manufacturing

  Health protection during the manufacturing process:

  Owing to the manufacturing conditions, no special

  statutory or regulatory measures are required as

  regards employee health protection. The statutory limit

  values are fallen short of.

  Environmental protection during the manufacturing

  process:

  Used air: Emissions are significantly lower than the

  limit values specified by the immission protection

  approval.

  Waste water: The production process does not involve

  waste water.

  Noise emissions: Measured values are below the

  permissible values of the immission protection

  approval thanks to sound protection measures.

  The location is certified to /DIN EN ISO

  14001:2004/and /EMAS III/I.

  2.8 Product processing/Installation

  Wood-processing machinery such as conventional

  portable circular saws and jigsaws are suitable for

  processing GUTEX wood fibre boards.

  Industrial and environmental protection:

  The guidlines provided by the professional liability

  associations must be maintained during processing of

  wood fibre insulating boards. No environmental

  pollution is incurred by processing/installing the wood

  fibre boards. No special measures need to be taken to

  protect the environment.

  2.9 Packaging

  Disposable pallets made of wood, cardboard, PE

  straps and PE stretch foil are used for packaging and

  can be directed to the recycling process.

  2.10 Condition of use

  The contents comply with those of the base material

  composition in section 2.5.

  2.11 Environment and health during use

  No environmental pollution or damage to health can be

  anticipated if GUTEX wood fibre boards are used as

  designated. The insulating board components are not

  referred to in the list of candidates in Annex IV of the

  /REACH/ Directive. Pollutants of health relevance are

  not emitted by the boards.

  2.12 Reference service life

  When used as designated, the useful life of GUTEX

  insulating boards complies with at least the useful life

  of the respective building. No Reference Service Life is

  declared on account of the multiple application

  possibilities.

  2.13 Extraordinary effects

  Fire

  All of the insulating boards listed comply with Euro

  class E in accordance with /DIN EN 13501-1/. The

  same combustion gases arise as when burning fir

  and/or spruce wood.

  Fire protection

  Name Value

  Building material class E

  Water

  No ingredients are washed out which could be

  hazardous to water.

  Mechanical destruction

  GUTEX insulating boards can be damaged when

  exposed to too high mechanical stresses (pressure

  and traction). The boards display an inconsistent

  appearance when fractured or damaged.

  No damage is incurred for the environment even when

  subject to unforeseen destruction., Coniferous wood: fir / spruce ca. 94,5 %, PUR
  resin max. 4,0 %, Paraffin max. 1,5 %, Coniferous wood: fir / spruce ca. 94,5 %

  PUR resin max. 4,0 %

  Paraffin max. 1,5 %


  ## LCA Notes

  EPD''s declared unit is 1 m3. Translation to 1m2 @RSI=1 involves the following assumptions:

  thickness based on avg thermal thermal conductivity value of range provided: 0.037
  - 0.050 W/(mK)

  mass based on assumed thickness and average of gross density of 173 kg/m3 (from
  3.1 Declared Unit)


  GWP reported in EPD for 1m3 = -164 kgCO2e

  GWP calculated for 1m2 RSI1 = (-164) * 0.0435 = -7.134 kgCO2e/m2RSI

  The above number includes stored biogenic carbon. GWP biogenic uptake is not reported
  separately in the EPD and is assumed to be standard 750 kgCO2e/m3 of wood product.
  Therefore the biogenic GWP uptake per 1 m2RSI of board is (-750 * 0.0435) = -32.625
  kgCO2e/m2RSI.

  The adjusted EC3 GWP with biogenic GWP removed is therefore -7.134 + 32.625 = 25.491
  kgCO2e/m2RSI


  See 6. LCA: Interpretation for note about inclusion of biogenic impacts'
