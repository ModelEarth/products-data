description: 'STIFERITE''S thermo insulation panels are mainly used in the building/construction
  sector and that of industrial insulation.

  The panels are made of thermo-setting closed cells polyurethane foam (PU) supplied
  with various types of flexible facers on both sides of the panel. The nature/type
  of facer contributes to the performance characteristics of the product and its application.

  Expanded rigid polyurethane foam is distinguished by its'' excellent thermo insulation
  performance, mechanical resistance, workability, lightness, and durability.

  The performance of STIFERITE''S panels is determined based on the European norm
  /EN 13165:2012+A1:2015 Thermal insulation products for buildings - Factory made
  rigid polyurethane foam (PU) products - Specification/.

  This EPD refers to STIFERITE CLASS SH Average thick panel, made of an insulation
  component in polyurethane foam using blowing agent Pentane-based, covered on both
  sides with saturated fiber glass. The saturated glass fibre coating ensures perfect
  compatibility and adhesion of the panel with the most common materials used in construction.
  Stiferite CLASS SH has high compressive strength. The panel is produced in standard
  dimensions of 600 x 1200 mm and straight finish edges. On request and for minimum
  quantities, the panels may be produced in various dimensions, and the edges may
  be rabbeted along the sides. The surface of the panel may be evened off by sandpaper
  in order to allow installation to uneven surfaces. STIFERITE CLASS SH Average thick
  panel is produced by a certified company with systems: /ISO 9001/, /OHSAS 18001/,
  /ISO 14001/ in its entire line of products.'

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nStiferite produces STIFERITE CLASS SH that\
  \ is a high performance insulation board manufactured from closed cell expanded\
  \ rigid polyurethane foam, covered on both sides with saturated fiber glass. The\
  \ data have been provided by the only Stiferite factory that is located in Padova\
  \ (Italy) for the year 2017. The owner of the declaration shall be liable for the\
  \ underlying information and evidence; the IBU shall not be liable with respect\
  \ to manufacturer information, life cycle assessment data and evidences. \nSystem\
  \ boundary: \nThis life cycle assessment for the production of the polyurethane\
  \ insulation board considers the life cycle from the supply of raw materials to\
  \ the manufacturer\xB4s gate (cradle-to-gate with options). It also includes the\
  \ transport to the construction site, the installation and the end-of-life stage\
  \ of the used PU thermal insulation board. The life cycle is split into the following\
  \ individual phases:\n A1 - Raw material formulation \n A2 - Raw material transport\n\
  \ A3 - Production of the insulation board and packaging material\n A4 - Transport\
  \ to the construction site\n A5 - Emissions and cutting losses during installation\
  \ and packaging disposal\n C2 - Transport to end-of-life\n C3/C4 - End-of-Life:\
