description: 'JACKODUR Plus is an extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) produced according
  to /EN 13164/ and available in board shape with a density range from 30 to 50 kg/m3,
  38.4 kg/m3 in average (measured). It has specifically low values of thermal conductivity
  by using HFO1234 ze as blowing agent. The boards can be delivered in various compressive
  strength values from 300 to 700 kPa. To meet the need of various applications the
  boards are produced with different surfaces: with the extrusion skin, planed, grooved
  or with thermal embossing. JACKODUR Plus boards are supplied with different edge
  treatments such as butt edge, ship lap and tongue and groove. The EPD is related
  to an unlaminated product only; lamination and additional product treatment are
  not considered. 2.2 Application The variety of the performance properties of JACKODUR
  Plus make it suitable for use in a large number of applications such as: perimeter
  insulation, inverted roof insulation , insulation of pitched roofs, floor insulation
  including insulation of highly loaded industrial floors, insulation of thermal bridges
  for exterior walls, External Thermal Insulation Composite'

lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nDeclared unit with thickness 100 mm 1\
  \ m2 Conversion factor to 1 kg 0.26 - Gross density 38.4 kg/m3 Declared unit 0.1\
  \ m3 JACKODUR Plus is available in several densities and thicknesses. For a product\
  \ with a density or thickness different from the reference density of 38.4 kg/m3\
  \ and 100 mm thickness, the environmental impacts may be calculated using the following\
  \ equation: Iadap - adapted LCIA indicator or LCI parameter Iref - LCIA indicator\
  \ or LCI parameter for reference density of 38.4 kg/m3 \u03C1radap - adapted density\
  \ \u03C1ref - reference density 38.4 kg/m3 dadap - adapted board thickness dref\
  \ - thickness of reference board (100 mm) Exceptions are impact categories, which\
  \ are not mainly driven by raw material consumption respective mass. That applies\
  \ to acidification potential and ozone depletion potential. These two categories\
  \ do not correlate directly with the mass of the product and cannot be evaluated\
  \ that way. 3.2 System boundary Type of EPD: cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) - with options\
  \ The following modules are considered in the Life Cycle Assessment: \u2022 Raw\
  \ material supply (A1), \u2022 Transport to manufacturer (A2), \u2022 Manufacturing\
  \ (A3), \u2022 Transport to construction site (A4) \u2022 Transport to disposal\
  \ (EoL) (C2), \u2022 Disposal (C4) with two scenarios (landfill (sc. 1) and thermal\
  \ treatment (sc. 2) \u2022 Reuse, recovery or recycling potential (D) with two scenarios\
  \ - beyond system boundary. 3.3 Estimates and assumptions The environmental profile\
  \ of the flame retardant is based on valid estimations, based on literature data,\
  \ basically /Ullmanns/. 3.4 Cut-off criteria In the assessment, all available data\
  \ from the production process are considered, i.e. all raw materials used, utilised\
  \ electric power consumption using best available LCI datasets. The amount of pigments,\
  \ which underruns a ratio of 0.5 mass-%, is included in the declared mass of polystyrene.\
  \ 3.5 Background data Background data is taken from the GaBi software /GaBi 2014/,\
  \ see www.gabi-software.com/databases. Additionally a life cycle inventory (LCI)\
  \ of an existing study on behalf of Honeywell, covering the impacts of the manufacturing\
  \ process of HFO1234ze blowing agent, has been used. The LCI is based on the ecoinvent\
  \ database v2-2 (2010). The producing Honeywell facility is located in US. The study\
  \ has been carried out in 2014. 5 Environmental Product Declaration Jackon Insulation\
  \ GmbH - XPS Foam Insulation Jackodur plus 3.6 Data quality The foreground data,\
  \ mainly the raw material and energy consumption during the production process is\
  \ measured data. Most of the necessary life cycle inventories are available in the\
  \ GaBi database. The last update of the database was 2014. 3.7 Period under review\
  \ The foreground data collected by JACKON Insulation are based on the yearly production\
  \ amount and extrapolations of measurements on specific machines and plants. The\
  \ production data refer to an average of the year 2014 in the JACKON plant Arendsee/Germany.\
  \ 3.8 Allocation There are no co-products generated during the XPS- production.\
  \ Allocations in the foreground system are done for waste respective recycling materials\
  \ only. Allocation for waste materials: Post-industrial XPS waste from extrusion\
  \ lines gets directly reused in the process. In the End of Life scenario all applied\
  \ incineration processes are displayed via a partial stream consideration for the\
  \ combustion process, according to the specific composition of the incinerated material.\
  \ For the waste incineration plant an R1-value of < 0.6 is assumed. Environmental\
  \ burden of the incineration of the product in the EoL-scenario are assigned to\
  \ the system (C4); resulting benefits for thermal and electrical energy are declared\
  \ in module D. Benefits are given according European average data for electrical\
  \ and thermal energy generated from natural gas. Allocation for upstream data For\
  \ all refinery products, allocation by mass and net calorific value has been applied.\
  \ The manufacturing route of every refinery product is modelled and the product-s"
