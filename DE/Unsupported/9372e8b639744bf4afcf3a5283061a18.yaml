lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis declaration covers the products of\
  \  ZinCo GmbH, which is based in N\xFCrtingen. The system components are mainly\
  \ produced in Germany. The \u201CHeather with Lavender\u201D system, which involves\
  \  simple intensive roof greening, was selected as a representative system. Information\
  \ on further system variants can be obtained from the manufacturer on request. The\
  \ planting of the green roof system does not  form a part of this declaration. \n\
  System boundary: \nCradle to gate with options, modules C1-C4 and D. \n\n\n\nDescription\
  \ of the system boundaries \n\nModule A1: Manufacturing processes of system components\
  \ incl. packaging and treatment of manufacturing losses from suppliers.Module A2:\
  \ Transport  to ZinCo Warehouse.\n\nModule A3: no loads or benefit  \n\nModule A4:\
  \ Transport to building site (100 km standard distance, needs to be adapted on building\
  \ level if relevant).\n\nModule A5: Installation of Substrate (by vacuum with Diesel\
  \ consumption) and treatment of installation losses. Treatment of packaging.\n\n\
  Module B1: Manufacturing of a representative amount of fertilizer (10 grams of nitrogen\
  \ per year). Emissions are not declared since vegetation is not under study.\n\n\
  Module C1: Deconstruction of the system. Substrate layer is assumed to be vacuumed\
  \ off the roof (Diesel consumption). All other system components are deconstructed\
  \ manually (no loads).\n\nModule C2: Transport to EoL treatment (50km standard distance;\
  \ may be adapted on building level).\n\nModule C3: Thermal treatment of plastics\
  \ (European Scenario).\n\nModule C4: Disposal of inert and biodegradable waste (European\

  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nA green roof type \u201CHeather with Lavender\u201D\
  \ serves to offer a permanent habitat on flat and slightly sloping roofs for a certain\
  \ kind of vegetation, to store water, to discharge excess water and to protect the\
  \ underlying roof construction. The system consists of four or five layers depending\
  \ on whether the roof to be planted is protected against root penetration or not\
  \ (see the graphic 1). In the case of standard root resistant waterproofing, the\
  \ Protection Mat SSM 45 is first laid to protect the waterproofing against mechanical\
  \ damage and to store rainwater. The mat is covered with 40 mm high Floradrain\xAE\
  \ FD 40 drainage and water storage elements, equipped on the upper side with recesses\
  \ and channels on the lower side. These elements are in turn covered with the Filter\
  \ Sheet SF to permanently guarantee the drainage function. The Filter Sheet is followed\
  \ by a layer of System Substrate of at least 100 mm in height. It consists mainly\
  \ of crushed mineral aggregates and selected organic components. The system substrate\
  \ layer is finally greened by sowing, planting or applying pre-grown vegetation\
  \ mats; the vegetation itself does not form part of this EPD. In exceptional cases\
  \ of not root resistant waterproofing, the waterproofing is first covered with the\
  \ Root Barrier WSF 40 or the Root Barrier WSB 100-PO, depending on the roof situation\
  \ and/or planting, before the Protection Mat SSM 45 is laid.The Root Barriers are\
  \ not part of this declaration. The \u201CHeather with Lavender\u201D green roof\
  \ system is applied above the usually root resistant waterproofing on sufficiently\
  \ stable flat or slightly sloping roofs in accordance with the sequence of components\
  \ described in \"Product description/Product definition\u201D. Roofs greened with\
  \ this system provide ecological, urban development and constructional benefits\
  \ such as the creation of new living space for flora and fauna, buffering of areas\
  \ for microclimate improvement, areas for water retention or urban gardening. \n\
  Technical data: \nAmongst others, the requirements of European Technical Assessment\
  \ ETA-13/0668 entitled \u201CKits for Green Roofs\u201D of 12th June 2018 apply\
  \ for the \u201CHeather with Lavender\u201D green roof system. The performance characteristics\
  \ which this assessment requires are shown in the following table: \nDeclared unit:\
  \ \nThe declared unit is one square meter of installed green roof system without\
  \ root protection and vegetation layer."
