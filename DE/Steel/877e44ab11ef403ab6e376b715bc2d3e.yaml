description: Dowel-type fasteners with thread, e.g. screws made of steel, are fasteners
  that can predominantly be used for fastening two or more components. The materials
  to be fastened or screw-in surfaces can be made of wood, wood materials, plastic,
  aluminium, steel, stainless steel or other metals. Pin-shaped connectors, such as
  screws, are generally manufactured from a wire (steel) and provided with a head
  on one component side to be tightened. Depending on the application, it can have
  different shapes, e.g. countersunk head, round head, hexagon head or washer head.
  For anchoring the pin-shaped connectors, a thread is formed on the opposite side.
  The thread shape (e.g. wood thread or metric thread) is matched to the screw-in
  surface and can be designed differently in terms of thread height, thread angle
  or thread pitch. The point design of the dowel-type fasteners with thread is matched
  to the application, e.g. wooden tip, drill tip or blunt shape. For protection against
  corrosion or e.g. for setting a sliding friction, the pin-shaped connectors can
  be provided with different coatings, for example, zinc or anti-skid coating. Depending
  on the application, the additional use of suitable steel or stainless steel seals
  as well as EPDM seals (ethylene-propylene-diene rubber), washers or nuts is provided.
  Depending on the application, the dowel-type fasteners with thread can be subject
  to legal national or European requirements such as the Construction Products Regulation.
  For example, the following documentation possibilities may be available

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis EPD relates to timber screws, chipboard\
  \ screws, drilling and tapping screws, screws for plastics, metric screws and dowel-type\
  \ fasteners with thread made of steel or stainless steel. Depending on the type\
  \ of screw, these products are generally used for fastening two or more components\
  \ made of wood, steel or plastic. \n\nThe declared environmental data related to\
  \ 1 kg of steel are based on a weighted average of steel screws in a Wrth manufacturing\
  \ plant, SWG Schraubenwerk Gaisbach GmbH and internationalized with generic data.\
  \ The holder of the declaration shall be liable for the underlying information and\
  \ supporting documents; any liability of IBU (Institut Bauen und Umwelt e. V.) with\
  \ regard to manufacturer information, life cycle assessment data and supporting\
  \ documents is hereby excluded. The EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) was\
  \ created in accordance with EN 15804 + A2: 2022-03. In the following, the standard\
  \ is referred to in simplified form as EN 15804. \nSystem boundary: \nType of the\
  \ EPD: cradle-to-gate - with options, modules C1-C4 and module D (A1-A3 + C + D\
  \ and additional modules: A4, A5).\n\nProduction Stage (A1-A3): The Product stage\
  \ includes:\n\xB7 A1 Raw material supply and processing (mainly steel),\n\xB7 A2\
  \ Transport of raw materials to the manufacturer,\n\xB7 A3 Production of Stainless\
  \ steel screws (incl. energy provision, treatment of production waste, production\
  \ of packaging materials).\n\nConstruction stage (A4-A5): The construction process\
  \ stage includes:\n\xB7 A4 transport to the construction site 100 km by truck,\n\
  \xB7 A5 Disposal of the packaging and installation of the Stainless steel screw.\n\
  \nEnd-of-life stage (C1-C4): The end-of-life stage includes:\n\xB7 C1 machine-assisted\
  \ de- construction (Hand-screwdriver; battery operated); Direct reuse would theoretically\
  \ be possible, but is not recommended, as the slide coating can be destroyed by\
  \ the initial screw-in process and the function of the fastener can no longer be\
  \ guaranteed after repeated use.\n\xB7 C2 transport to waste processing; 50 km with\
  \ truck Transport distance can be adjusted at building level if necessary (e.g.,\
  \ for 100 km actual transport distance: multiply LCA values by factor 2)\n\xB7 C3\
  \ waste processing for recycling of steel.\n\xB7 C4 no components of the product\
  \ are landfilled.\n\nBenefits and loads beyond the System Boundary (D): Module D\
  \ includes:\nMaterial recovery potentials from metal recycling and energy recovery\
  \ potentials from the\nthermal recovery of Packaging.\n\n# Technology Description\
  \ And Included Processes\n\nPin-shaped connectors, such as screws, are generally\
  \ manufactured from a wire (steel) and provided with a head on one component side\
  \ to be tightened. Depending on the application, it can have different shapes, e.g.\
  \ countersunk head, round head, hexagon head or washer head. For anchoring the pin-shaped\
  \ connectors, a thread is formed on the opposite side. The thread shape (e.g. wood\
  \ thread or metric thread) is matched to the screw-in surface and can be designed\
  \ differently in terms of thread height, thread angle or thread pitch. The point\
  \ design of the dowel-type fasteners with thread is matched to the application,\
  \ e.g. wooden tip, drill tip or blunt shape. For protection against corrosion or\
  \ e.g. for setting a sliding friction, the pin-shaped connectors can be provided\
  \ with different coatings, for example zinc or anti-skid coating. Currently, mainly\
  \ the following production methods are used to produce dowel-type fasteners with\
  \ thread: cold or hot extrusion processes with multi-stage pressing tools. The starting\
  \ material is delivered as coiled wire on spools and is uncoiled and straightened\
  \ in the upstream plant. Modern cold and hot extrusion presses operate in multiple\
  \ stages, i.e. several steps are carried out in a single operation, such as shearing\
  \ of the blank, preforming of the screw head, final upsetting, deburring and reduction\
  \ of the threaded part. In a next step, the thread of the screw is formed without\
  \ cutting using a thread rolling machine. For self-drilling screws, pinching of\
  \ the drill tip takes place before thread rolling. Between each working step, the\
  \ parts are washed in a washing facility specially provided for this purpose. Depending\
  \ on the product, hardening of the material can also take place. Finally, the screw\
  \ surface is galvanized and coated. \nTechnical data: \nStructural data for the\
  \ respective dowel-type fasteners with thread are provided in the corresponding\
  \ approvals and technical drawings, as shown below in an excerpt from ETA 11/0190\
  \ (ASSY) for wood screws. \nDeclared unit: \n1 kg average self-tapping screws made\
  \ of steel:"
