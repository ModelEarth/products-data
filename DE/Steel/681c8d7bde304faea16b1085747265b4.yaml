  constructions from Give Steel are designed and produced according to European design
  codes and production standards, as well as in compliance with project specifications.
  While Eurocode 1 and Eurocode 3 apply to the design and civil engineering works,
  manufacturing is carried out according to EN 1090 for steel construction. Furthermore,
  these codes and standards outline specific product standards for choosing the most
  appropriate constitute products for each component. Such standards include EN 10025
  which defines the requirements for non-alloy and fine grain weldable structural
  steels, EN 10219 for cold formed hollow sections and EN 13479 and ISO 544 which
  sets out the same set of requirements for materials.

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe declaration covers painted structural\
  \ steel produced at the production site in Brande, Denmark. The declaration covers\
  \ all life cycle modules from A1-A5, C1-C4 and D and is based on product-specific\
  \ data provided by Give Steel A/S and background data from GaBi professional 2020\
  \ and Ecoinvent v3.6. \nSystem boundary: \nType of EPD: Cradle to gate with options.\
  \ \nModule A1-A3, A4, A5, B1-B7, C1-C4 and D are considered. Yet, no environmental\
  \ impacts are associated with modules B1-B7, thus, these modules are declared as\
  \ not relevant. \n\nModules A1-A3 include the acquisition of all raw materials,\
  \ products and energy, transport to the production site, the manufacturing of the\
  \ painted structural steel and waste processing up to the end-of-waste state.\n\n\
  Module A4 includes the transport of the product to the construction site. \n\nModule\
  \ A5 includes the installation of the product using a diesel truck. \n\nModule C1\
  \ considers the deconstruction of the structural steel using a truck. In module\
  \ C2, the demolished steel is transported to a waste processing site, with the waste\
  \ processing considered in module C3.\n\nFinally, module D considers the benefits\
  \ from recycling the demolished steel parts.\n\n# Technology Description And Included\
  \ Processes\n\nThe product stage comprises the acquisition of all raw materials,\
  \ products and energy, transport to the production site, packaging and waste processing\
  \ up to the \u201Dend-of-waste\u201D state or final disposal. The LCA results are\
  \ declared in aggregated form for the product stage, which means. that the sub-modules\
  \ A1, A2 and A3 are declared as one module A1-A3. The raw materials: flat iron,\
  \ plate and beams are brought in, processed, shot cleaned, cut and welded. The process\
  \ will vary, depending on the involved raw material. The various materials are transported\
  \ by side loader from our warehouse to the appropriate production machines: Flat\
  \ iron to the CNC flat iron machine, plate to the CNC plasma cutter and beams to\
  \ the shot ball cleaner. Flat iron is processed if necessary, by adding holes and\
  \ cutting into strips. Plate is plasma cut following 2D models. Beams are shot cleaned\
  \ and cut to length. Flat iron, steel plate and beams are shot cleaned before production\
  \ to produce the correct surface. The shot cleaner is always kept full to save power.\
  \ The steel balls are reused in production until steel dust is all that remains.\
  \ After cleaning, flat iron and plate are distributed for use as beams and to the\
  \ welding robot, respectively. Beams and associated plates are stapled together.\
  \ Beams are then welded, according to design diagrams. When manufacturing welded\
  \ wedges for robot welding, all parts are assembled from the CNC cutting table and\
  \ CNC flat iron cutter. Once the parts are collected they are stapled together according\
  \ to design diagrams. The stapled wedges are robot welded and sent on. The remaining\
  \ components are mounted or welded manually. When the items are ready for surface\
  \ treatment, they are moved to the factory's painting booth, where they are painted\
  \ according to the desired paint system, which is shown on a label on the beam.\
  \ Drying follows the specifications of the paint supplier. Once dry, the painted\
  \ beams are ready for transportation to the construction site. \nTechnical data:\
  \ \nThis EPD is valid for painted structural steel of different forms of delivery.\
  \ Specific information on dimension tolerances, constructional data as well as mechanical\
  \ and chemical properties can be found in the relevant literature and/or the standards.\
  \ \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared unit is 1 ton of painted structural steel. \n\
  The paint accounts for 1 % of the products weight-%."
