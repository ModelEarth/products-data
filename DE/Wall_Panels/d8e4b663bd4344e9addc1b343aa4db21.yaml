lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nPolyvinyl chloride, 40, Rice husk, 27,\
  \ Calcium carbonate filler, 20, Acrylic polymer, 5, Impact modifier, 4, Stabiliser,\
  \ 4, Pigment, 1\n\n## Source Data Notes\nForeground System Modules A1-A3: primary\
  \ data relating to the production of the Resysta material mix in 2015 were supplied\
  \ by Resysta International GmbH based on production at their manufacturing site\
  \ in Munich, Germany. Primary data could not be obtained for the second production\
  \ stage but Resysta confirmed that this was a standard industrial compounding process\
  \ so it was modelled based on GaBi data for equivalent processes. Salamander Technische\
  \ Kunststoffprofile GmbH provided primary data for extrusion of the finished decking\
  \ and fa\xE7ade profiles in 2015. Modules A4-A5: distribution and installation was\
  \ modelled based on representative data supplied by Falcon Panel Products Ltd for\
  \ use by customers in the UK. It is assumed that 2% of product is wasted during\
  \ installation and the additional quantity of Resysta profiles needed to make up\
  \ for this loss is also modelled. The split between end-of-life options is the same\
  \ as that described for modules C1-C4 below. Installation materials (screws, batons,\
  \ etc.) have been excluded from this assessment as these will vary according to\
  \ the specific requirements of each construction project. Modules B1-B7: Resysta\
  \ profiles are very long-lasting and hard-wearing so the use phase scenario is based\
  \ on the assumption that the use phase lifetime will be 60 years (as noted in the\
  \ Scenario Table at the end of this EPD). Resysta profiles do not have any emissions\
  \ associated with their use, therefore the results for module B1 have been assessed\
  \ as zero. Due to the high durability of Resysta profiles it is assumed that once\
  \ installed there will be no requirement for further treatment or maintenance (e.g.\
  \ painting/varnishing, repair or refurbishment) during this lifetime; therefore\
  \ the results for modules B2-B5 are assessed as zero. Resysta profiles require no\
  \ water or energy during building operation so the results for modules B6 and B7\
  \ have also been assessed as zero. Modules C1-C4: it is assumed that deconstruction\
  \ at end of life is undertaken manually. The end of life scenario is based on representative\
  \ data for disposal of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste in the UK\
  \ in 2016 (89.2% of the waste is sent for energy recovery and 10.8% to landfill).\
  \ 0.540 kWh is recovered from each kg Resysta profile sent to energy recovery. Module\
  \ D: credits are assigned for recovered electricity from incineration of waste Resysta\
  \ profiles generated during installation and at end of life. It is assumed that\
  \ this recovered electricity avoids an equivalent amount of electricity supplied\
  \ by the UK grid mix. No credits are assigned for thermal energy as this is not\
  \ typically recovered in the UK. EPD Number: 000170 Date of Issue: 07 December 2017\
  \ Expiry Date 22 October 2022 BF1805-C-ECOP Rev 0.0 Page 7 of 17 \xA9 BRE Global\
  \ Ltd, 2017 Background System The LCA was modelled using GaBi LCA software. The\
  \ background system comprising impacts associated with raw material production,\
  \ energy generation, distribution, waste treatment, etc. were based on the most\
  \ up to date datasets available sourced from the GaBi 2017 databases. Allocation\
  \ Economic allocation was used to partition burdens associated with rice cultivation\
  \ and milling to the rice husks, which is a co-product of rice milling (along with\
  \ white rice, rice bran and rice polish). On this basis, 2.3% of the total impacts\
  \ of these processes were allocated to the rice husks. Allocation of site-wide data\
  \ for production processes was not required as production takes place at dedicated\
  \ facilities and no co-products are generated. No other allocation was required\
  \ in the foreground system. Allocation in the background datasets was as reported\
  \ in the GaBi database documentation available here: http://www.gabi-software.com/international/support/gabi/."
