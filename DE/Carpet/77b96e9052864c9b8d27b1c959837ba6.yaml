description: 'This EPD applies to Gradus Premium Loop Pile Tufted, Bitumen Backed
  Carpet Tile with Nylon face fibre. The carpet tile backing system contains a modified
  bitumen polymer, mineral filler, and a fibreglass reinforcement layer for dimensional
  stability. The face fibre is made of solution-dyed Nylon that is tufted into a primary
  backing sheet, then latex is added to anchor the fibre in place to assure maximum
  tuft bind. The bitumen-based backing system is then applied to create a durable
  flooring solution for use in varied applications. The carpet tiles are then die-cut
  and packaged for distribution. This Gradus Premium Loop Pile Tufted, Bitumen Backed
  Carpet Tile is a commercial carpet tile, suitable for use in all commercial settings
  as a floor covering, in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. It has a life span
  of 12 years and comes with a 12-year wear warranty (subject only to installation
  and maintenance being carried out in line with manufacturers guidelines). The product
  meets both internal and external performance standards including those established
  in the EU under EN 1307 and EN 10874 for a product suitable for heavy and general
  commercial installations. This product is manufactured in the UK. Raw materials
  are responsibly sourced through supply chain, chemical and waste management programs.
  No co-products are produced in the manufacturing of these premium carpet tiles.
  Detailed Product Descriptions: Urban Myth is a textured loop pile carpet available
  in both tile and plank format. The random design offers versatility and the opportunity
  to create innovative and complimentary colours comprising six grey base tones and
  six vibrant accent colours that can be combined to create stunning installations.
  Lunar is a tufted loop pile carpet tile. Inspired by the lunar landscape, the design
  is available in a choice of eight colourways to help create a stylish and modern
  environment. Lunar is suitable for use in a wide range of applications including

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nA Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted\
  \ based upon production data collected from Gradus, Ltd. manufacturing facility\
  \ (Chapel Mill, Park Green, Macclesfield, Cheshire, SK11 7LZ), located in Scotland,\
  \ UK. Production data was collected for Gradus Premium Loop Pile Tufted, Bitumen\
  \ Backed Carpet Tile with Nylon Face Fibre, for the period of one year, from January\
  \ to December 2021.\n\nThis EPD is cradle-to-gate with options in scope with additional\
  \ modules A4, A5, B1 and B2. The EPD is created in accordance to the specifications\
  \ of EN 15804+A2.\n\nThe functional unit has been defined as 1 m2 of installed Gradus\
  \ Premium Loop Pile Tufted, Bitumen Backed Carpet Tile.\n\nThe EPD was generated\
  \ with the help of Envision LCA Tool, version 1. The tool has not been manipulated\
  \ in calculating impact results. The current version of the tool is maintained,\
  \ saved, and stored for 10 years to be used for revision and re-traceability purposes.\
  \ \nSystem boundary: \nThe type of EPD is Cradle-to-Gate with options modules C1\u2013\
  \ C4, module D, and additional modules. The additional modules are A4, A5, B1 and\
  \ B2.\n\nThe modules considered in the life cycle assessment and environmental product\
  \ declaration, based on the products entire life cycle, are described as follows:\n\
  \nProduction Stage:  \n\nModule A1 - Provision of Raw Materials.\nModule A2 - Transport\
  \ of Raw Materials.\nModule A3 - Manufacturing.Construction/Installation Stage:\n\
  \nModule A4 - Transportation by truck of the product to the construction site in\
  \ Europe. \nModule A5 - Installation of the carpet, treatment of cutting waste (landfill)\
  \ and packaging waste (landfill, recycling, and incineration). The production of\
  \ the amount of carpet that occurs as installation waste is also included along\
  \ with its transport to the place of installation. Biogenic carbon that is stored\
  \ in the wooden pallets and cardboard (packaging) is released as carbon dioxide\
  \ emissions into the air at the end of life in module A5.Use Stage:\n\nModule B1\
  \ - Indoor emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the first few months\
  \ after installation.\nModule B2 - Carpet cleaning per year, including vacuuming\
  \ (electricity consumption) and hot water cleaning (electricity and water consumption,\
  \ as well as waste water treatment).\nModule B3 - Repair (module not relevant).\n\
  Module B4 - Replacement (module not relevant).\nModule B5 - Refurbishment (module\
  \ not relevant).\nModule B6 - Operational Energy Use (module not relevant).\nModule\
  \ B7 - Operational Water Use (module not relevant).End of Life Stage:\nThree scenarios\
  \ have been evaluated:\nScenario 1: the Gradus Bitumen Backed carpet is 100% disposed\
  \ of in a landfill.\nScenario 2: the Gradus Bitumen Backed carpet is 100% incinerated.\
  \ \nScenario 3: 40% of Gradus Bitumen Backed carpets are incinerated and the remaining\
  \ 60% are landfilled. This assumption is based on the carpet disposal rates in Europe\
  \ mentioned in the study conducted by Deutsche Umwelthilfe in 2017 (Umwelthilfe,\
  \ 2017) and the European Commission in 2013 (Commission, 2013).\n\nModule C1 - The\
  \ carpet is de-constructed manually and no additional environmental impact is caused.\n\
  Module C2 - Transport of the carpet waste to a landfill or to the municipal waste\
  \ incineration plant.\nModule C3 - Impacts from thermal treatment disposal (C3/2\
  \ and C3/3).\nModule C4 - Impacts from landfill disposal (C4/1 and C4/3).Module\
  \ D includes benefits from energy recovery via treatment of packaging materials\
  \ and incineration of carpets at their end of life (D/1, D/2 and D/3), as well as\
  \ the burdens of balancing the secondary material content in modules A1 and A3 via\
  \ the net-scrap approach.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\n\
  This EPD applies to carpet tile with bitumen backing system together with STS premium\
  \ loop pile tufted Nylon face fibre. STS is a commercial carpet tile, for use as\
  \ a floor covering in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. \nTechnical\
  \ data: \nThe technical specifications of the product are listed on the products\
  \ specification sheet, found at www.gradus.com. This product meets the requirements\
  \ of the harmonized European Norm (hEN): EN14041:2004A/C:2006. Declarations of performance\
  \ related to fire, electrostatic, formaldehyde emissions, and slip resistance can\
  \ be found on the products specification sheet. \nDeclared unit: \nThe declaration\
  \ refers to the declared unit of 1 m of installed carpet tile."
