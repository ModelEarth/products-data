description: "This EPD applies to carpet tile with TaskWorx\xAE backing system together\
  \ with EcoSolution Q\xAE, Solution Q\xAE, or Solution Q Extreme\xAE Nylon face fibre.\
  \ TaskWorx\xAE is a commercial carpet tile, for use as a floor covering in accordance\
  \ with the manufacturers guidelines. The carpet tile consists of Shaws unique face\
  \ fibre, Nylon 6, manufactured with 1% recycled material on the TaskWorx\xAE backing\
  \ system, a modified bitumen compound with 100% natural recycled mineral filler,\
  \ and a fibreglass reinforcement layer. The EcoSolution Q\xAE, Solution Q\xAE, or\
  \ Solution Q Extreme\xAE face fibre is tufted into a primary backing sheet containing\
  \ recycled content. Latex is added to anchor the fibre and the TaskWorx\xAE backing\
  \ system is then applied. TaskWorx\xAE is suitable for use in all commercial settings.\
  \ It has a life span of 15 years, and it comes with a 15-year warranty (subject\
  \ only to installation and maintenance being carried out in line with manufacturers\
  \ guidelines). The product meets both internal and external performance standards\
  \ including those established in the EU under EN 1307 and EN 10874 for a product\
  \ suitable for heavy and general commercial installations."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nA Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted\
  \ based upon production data collected from Shaw Contract (Shaw Europe, Ltd.), Plant\
  \ SQ manufacturing facility (Blackaddie Road, Sanquhar, DG46DB), located in Scotland,\
  \ UK. Production data was collected for TaskWorx\xAE Carpet Tile with EcoSolution\
  \ Q\xAE, Solution Q\xAE, or Solution Q Extreme\xAE Face Fibre, for the period of\
  \ one year, from January to December 2021.\n\nThis EPD is cradle-to-gate with options\
  \ in scope with additional modules A4, A5, B1 and B2. The EPD is created in accordance\
  \ to the specifications of EN 15804+A2. \n\nThe functional unit has been defined\
  \ as 1m2 of installed TaskWorx\xAE Carpet Tile.\n\nThe EPD was generated with the\
  \ help of Envision LCA Tool, version 1. The tool has not been manipulated in calculating\
  \ impact results. The current version of the tool is maintained, saved, and stored\
  \ for 10 years to be used for revision and re-traceability purposes. \nSystem boundary:\
  \ \nThe type of EPD is Cradle-to-Gate with options modules C1\u2013 C4, module D,\
  \ and additional modules. The additional modules are A4, A5, B1 and B2. \n\nThe\
  \ modules considered in the life cycle assessment and environmental product declaration,\
  \ based on the products entire life cycle, are described as follows:\n\nProduction\
  \ Stage:  \n\nModule A1 - Provision of Raw Materials.\nModule A2 - Transport of\
  \ Raw Materials.\nModule A3 - Manufacturing.Construction/Installation Stage:\n\n\
  Module A4 - Transportation by truck of the product to the construction site in Europe.\n\
  Module A5 - Installation of the carpet, treatment of cutting waste (landfill) and\
  \ packaging waste (landfill, recycling, and incineration). The production of the\
  \ amount of carpet that occurs as installation waste is also included along with\
  \ its transport to the place of installation. Biogenic carbon that is stored in\
  \ the wooden pallets and cardboard (packaging) is released as carbon dioxide emissions\
  \ into the air at the end of life in module A5.Use Stage:\n\nModule B1 - Indoor\
  \ emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the first few months after\
  \ installation.\nModule B2 - Carpet cleaning per year, including vacuuming (electricity\
  \ consumption) and hot water cleaning (electricity and water consumption, as well\
  \ as waste water treatment).\nModule B3 - Repair (module not relevant).\nModule\
  \ B4 - Replacement (module not relevant).\nModule B5 - Refurbishment (module not\
  \ relevant).\nModule B6 - Operational Energy Use (module not relevant).\nModule\
  \ B7 - Operational Water Use (module not relevant).End of Life Stage:\nThree scenarios\
  \ have been evaluated: \nScenario 1: the TaskWorx\xAE carpet is 100% disposed of\
  \ in a landfill.\nScenario 2: the TaskWorx\xAE carpet is 100% incinerated. \nScenario\
  \ 3: 40% of TaskWorx\xAE carpets are incinerated and the remaining 60% are landfilled.\
  \ This assumption is based on the carpet disposal rates in Europe mentioned in the\
  \ study conducted by Deutsche Umwelthilfe in 2017 (Umwelthilfe, 2017) and the European\
  \ Commission in 2013 (Commission, 2013).\n\nModule C1 - The carpet is de-constructed\
  \ manually and no additional environmental impact is caused.\nModule C2 - Transport\
  \ of the carpet waste to a landfill or to the municipal waste incineration plant.\n\
  Module C3 - Impacts from thermal treatment disposal (C3/2 and C3/3).\nModule C4\
  \ - Impacts from landfill disposal (C4/1 and C4/3).Module D includes benefits from\
  \ energy recovery via treatment of packaging materials and incineration of carpets\
  \ at their end of life (D/1, D/2 and D/3), as well as the burdens of balancing the\
  \ secondary material content in modules A1 and A3 via the net-scrap approach.\n\n\
  # Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nThis EPD applies to carpet tile\
  \ with TaskWorx\xAE backing system together with EcoSolution Q\xAE, Solution Q\xAE\
  , or Solution Q Extreme\xAE Nylon face fibre. TaskWorx\xAE is a commercial carpet\
  \ tile, for use as a floor covering in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines.\
  \ \nTechnical data: \nThe technical specifications of the product are listed on\
  \ the products specification sheet, found at www.shawcontract.com. This product\
  \ meets the requirements of the harmonized European Norm (hEN): EN14041:2004A/C:2006.\
  \ Declarations of performance related to fire, electrostatic, formaldehyde emissions,\
  \ and slip resistance can be found on the products specification sheet. \nDeclared\
  \ unit: \nThe declaration refers to the declared unit of 1 m of installed carpet\
  \ tile."
