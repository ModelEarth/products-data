lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe manufacturer declaration applies to\
  \ tufted carpet tiles with a Sone+ polyester felt covered CQuest Bio backing, a\
  \ pile material of 100% recycled PA 6 with a maximum total pile weight of 1500 g/m2.\
  \ The products are tufted in Scherpenzeel, the Netherlands, or in Craigavon, Ireland.\
  \ The carpets are back coated in Scherpenzeel.\nLCA results for products with a\
  \ maximum total pile weight of 535 g/m2 can be taken from the corresponding tables\
  \ of the annexe. Specific data for every product within the declared group of products\
  \ in relation to its total pile weight can be calculated by using equation 1 given\
  \ in the annexe (see annexe chapter: General Information on the annexe). The declaration\
  \ is only valid in conjunction with a valid GUT-PRODIS license of the product. \n\
  System boundary: \nType of EPD: Cradle-to-gate with options\nSystem boundaries of\
  \ modules A, B, C, D:\nModules C3, C4 and D are indicated separately for three end-of-life\
  \ scenarios:\n1 - landfill disposal\n2 - municipal waste incineration\n3 - recovery\
  \ in a cement plant\nA1-A3 Production:\nEnergy supply and production of the basic\
  \ material, processing of secondary material, auxiliary material, transport of the\
  \ material to the manufacturing site, emissions, waste water treatment, packaging\
  \ material and waste processing up to the landfill disposal of residual waste (except\
  \ radioactive waste). Benefits for generated electricity and steam due to the incineration\
  \ of production waste are aggregated. Biogenic carbon that is stored in renewable\
  \ material (wood resin, renewable additives,packaging paper) is taken into account\
  \ as well as the associated carbon dioxide uptake from the air from which this biogenic\
  \ carbon comes.\n\nA4 Transport:\nTransport of the packed textile floor covering\
  \ from factory gate to the place of installation.\n\nA5 Installation:\nInstallation\
  \ of the textile floor covering, processing of installation waste and packaging\
  \ waste up to the landfill disposal of residual waste (except radioactive waste),\
  \ the production of the amount of carpet that occurs as installation waste including\
  \ its transport to the place of installation. Generated electricity and steam due\
  \ to the incineration of waste are listed in the result table as exported energy.\
  \ Biogenic carbon that is stored in renewable materials in installation waste and\
  \ packaging paper is released as carbon dioxide emissions into the air at the end\
  \ of life in module A5.\nPreparation of the floor and auxiliary materials (adhesives,\
  \ fixing agents, PET connectors) are beyond the system boundaries and not taken\
  \ into account.\n\nB1 Use:\nIndoor emissions during the use stage. After the first\
  \ year, no product-related Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions are relevant\
  \ due to known VOC decay curves of the product.\n\nB2 Maintenance:\nCleaning of\
  \ the textile floor covering for a period of 1 year:\nVacuum cleaning \u2013 electricity\
  \ supply\nWet cleaning \u2013 electricity, water consumption, production of the\
  \ cleaning agent, waste water treatment\nThe declared values in this module have\
  \ to be multiplied by the assumed service life of the floor covering in the building\
  \ in question.\n\nB3 - B5:\nThe modules are not relevant within the assumed reference\
  \ service life of 15 years.\n\nB6 - B7:\nNo energy and water input are required\
  \ for the operation of the carpet in the use stage. The modules do not cause any\
  \ environmental impact.\n\nC1 De-construction:\nThe floor covering is de-constructed\
  \ manually and no additional environmental impact is caused.\n\nC2 Transport:\n\
  Transport\nof the carpet waste to a landfill, to the municipal waste incineration\
  \ plant (MWI) or to the waste collection facility for recycling.\n\nC3 Waste processing:\n\
  C3-1: Landfill disposal needs no waste processing. \nC3-2: Impact from waste incineration\
  \ (plant with R1 > 0.6), generated electricity and steam are listed in the result\
  \ table as exported energy.\nC3-3:\nCollection of the carpet waste for recovery\
  \ in the cement industry, waste processing (granulating), transport to the cement\
  \ plant, emissions from the incineration.\n\nC4 Disposal\nC4-1: Impact from landfill\
  \ disposal,\nC4-2: The carpet waste leaves the system in module C3-2,\nC4-3: The\
  \ pre-processed carpet waste leaves the system in module C3-3.\n\nD Recycling potential:\n\
  Calculated benefits result from materials exclusive secondary materials (net materials).\n\
  D-A5: Benefits for generated energy due to incineration of packaging and installation\
  \ waste (incineration plant with R1 > 0.6), \nD-1: Assuming that the chemically\
  \ bound renewable materials in a landfill gas do not release landfill gas within\
  \ 100 years, no benefits due to landfill dosposal of carpet waste at the end-of-life\
  \ are taken into account,\nD-2: Benefits for generated energy due to incineration\
  \ of carpet waste at the end-of-life (incineration plant with R1 > 0.6),\nD-3: Benefits\
  \ for saved fossil energy and saved inorganic material due to recovery of the carpet\
  \ in a cement plant.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nTufted\
  \ modular carpet tiles having a pile material of polyamide 6 yarn from 100% recycled\
  \ content with a Sone+ acoustic felt covered CQuest Bio backing. \nTechnical data:\
  \ \nThe performance data listed in the Declaration of Performance (DoP) apply."
