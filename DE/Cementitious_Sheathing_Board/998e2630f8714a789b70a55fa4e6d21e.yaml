description: "The products declared in this EPD concern large-format, smooth panels\
  \ made of naturally hardened fiber cement, uncoated, with glazed or covering coating.\
  \ NATURA is a glaze-coated fa\xE7ade panel with a translucent surface structure.\

  \ class 1c) declaration of an average product from one plant of one manufacturer,\
  \ as stated in the /IBU PCR part A/. The weighted average is based on the market\
  \ share of the products. For the placing on the market of the product in the EU/EFTA\
  \ (with exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (PCR) applies. The\
  \ product has a Declaration of Performance taking into consideration /EN12467:2012/,\

lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nThis declaration refers to the manufacture,\
  \ installation and end-of-life treatment of 1m\xB2 NATURA, TEXTURA and MATERIA produced\
  \ in the Eternit A.G. plant in Neubeckum. The values declared in this EPD represent\
  \ a weighted average based on the market shares of the three products. All products\
  \ are produced in the same factory in Neubeckum and all put on the German market.\
  \ The functional unit mentioned in the IBU PCR part B is 1 ton. As the weight of\
  \ 1m\xB2 installed NATURA, TEXTURA or MATERIA is 15,07kg or 0,015 ton, one ton equals\
  \ 66,36 m\xB2 of installed NATURA, TEXTURA or MATERIA. The LCA models are depicted\
  \ on the basis of a 8mm- thick panel (corresponds with 15,07kg). All other thickness-dependent\
  \ results can therefore be generated as required by linear scaling of the basic\
  \ panel to the requisite thickness. Declared unit Name Value Unit Declared unit\
  \ m\xB2 1 t Gross density > 1650 kg/m3 Conversion factor to 1 kg 15.07 - Conversion\
  \ factor for FU 1 ton 66,36 m\xB2 3.2 System boundary Type of the EPD: cradle to\
  \ grave. The modules considered in the Life Cycle Assessment are product stage A1-A3,\
  \ installation stage A4-A5, use stage B, end-of-life stage C1-C4 and module D. 3.3\
  \ Estimates and assumptions Specific /Ecoinvent/ processes are not available for\
  \ all preliminary products. As the cellulose used in the production is plant based,\
  \ the ROW data record for wood chips is used. The modeling of the pigment is based\
  \ on the compilation declared by the manufacturer. 3.4 Cut-off criteria All operating\
  \ data, i.e. all of the starting materials used, thermal energy, internal fuel consumption\
  \ and electricity consumption, all direct waste as well as all emission measurements\
  \ available were taken into account in the analyses. Ancillary materials needed\
  \ in the production process with mass and impact less than 1% are treated as cut-offs.\
  \ Machinery, plants and infrastructure required in the manufacturing process are\
  \ neglected. The biogenic carbon included in the wooden pallets for packaging is\
  \ not included in the LCA. No uptake nor release of biogenic carbon is modeled.\
  \ 3.5 Background data In order to model fiber cement production /SimaPro 8.5/ and\
  \ Ecoinvent 3.4 was used. The life Cycle Assessment was drawn up for Germany as\
  \ a reference area. This means that, apart from the production processes under these\
  \ marginal conditions, the pre- stages also of relevance for Germany, such as provision\
  \ of electricity or energy carriers were used. The power mix for Germany is applied\
  \ with 2016 as the year of reference. 3.6 Data quality Corresponding consistent\
  \ data records were available for most of the relevant preliminary products and\
  \ ancillary materials. Other preliminary products such as PVA fibers, for example,\
  \ could be modeled using data from literature or proxys are assumed as declared\
  \ in \"Estimates and assumptions\". The Variability of the data is low since the\
  \ production process is identical except for the finishing. All materials and processes\
  \ are declared and integrated in the LCA. As all three products are sold on the\
  \ German market, there is no relevant geographical variability for the results.\
  \ The background data used was last revised less than 3 years ago. The production\
  \ data involves up-to-date industrial data on Eternit GmbH from 2016. 3.7 Period\
  \ under review The data applied for this LCA is based on data recorded by Eternit\
  \ GmbH for the manufacturing of NATURA, TEXTURA and MATERIA fa\xE7ade panels in\
  \ 2016. The volumes of raw materials energy, ancillary materials are considered\
  \ as average annual values in the Neubeckum plant. 3.8 Allocation The products are\
  \ manufactured in the Neubeckum plant. The production process of the three products\
  \ is identical except for the coating. Therefore the coating data distinguishing\
  \ Textura, Natura and Materia facade panels was recorded separately. For the LCA\
  \ of the average product the inventory data are modeled based on a mass allocation\
  \ according to the market share of the three products. Part of the energy produced\
  \ by the"
