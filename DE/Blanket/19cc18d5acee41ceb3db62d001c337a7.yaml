description: 'The product Climaver A1 APTA is a rigid panel made of ISOVER glass wool
  that has an excellent fire reaction since it does not contribute to extent or start
  a fire in any of its stages. It is a high-density panel, composed by different facings:
  the exterior facing is made of aluminum and fiber glass (acting as a vapor barrier),
  and the interior facing, made of reinforced fiber glass with high mechanical strength.'
