description: "Parador laminate floors belong to the group of hard floor elements,\
  \ have a highly abrasion-resistant coating layer and can be laid using the patented\
  \ click connection without bonding. Due to the printed and impregnated d\xE9cor\
  \ paper an individual look is created. A special production process gives the surface\
  \ a corresponding structure. The laminate floors are available in different plank\
  \ formats which are profiled with a high-precision click connection at the long\
  \ and end endges. The finished planks are packaged in foil and cardboards in the\
  \ factory to protect them from damage. All laminate floor coverings produced in\
  \ Coesfeld are part of the averaging process with their respective production shares."

lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nDeclared unit 1 m2 Conversion factor\
  \ to 1 kg 0.133 - Laminate flooring 7,45 kg/m\xB2 Packaging material 0,09 kg/m\xB2\
  \ Total weight 7,54 kg/m\xB2 3.2 System boundary Type of EPD: Cradle to Gate - with\
  \ options. The system boundaries for Module A1-3 include all raw material extraction\
  \ processes for material and energy used in Cradle to Gate, their processing into\
  \ preproducts and interim products and the manufacture of laminate floor coverings.\
  \ Modules A4 and A5 contain the transport and installation of the construction product\
  \ at the construction site. In this context packaging waste is also considered.\
  \ The Modules C2 and C3 cover transport and energy recovery of the product at End\
  \ of Life. 3.3 Estimates and assumptions The individual layers of the laminate flooring\
  \ were modeled on tolerances provided by the suppliers. Energy needs for production\
  \ facilities were obtained from the manufacturer and the internal energy analysis\
  \ was conducted by Parador. Based on distribution channels within Europe und the\
  \ applicable legal circumstances, collection rates for packaging materials at the\
  \ installation site (Module A5) and for the product at End of Life (Module C3) both\
  \ were assumed to be 95%. The average distance to disposal operations was estimated\
  \ at 75 km. 3.4 Cut-off criteria The d\xE9cor print, due to the very small amount\
  \ of ink applied, is cut off because neither adequate data sets nor official empirical\
  \ values or estimates exist. No information is available from the manufacturers\
  \ of purchased layers regarding energy consumption and waste generated in the upstream\
  \ production processes for each type of layer. Therefore, generic data sets are\
  \ used for upstream production processes. The use of adhesive labels and the modeling\
  \ of procurement transport for packaging, on the other hand, are completely disregarded.\
  \ It may be assumed that the total of disregarded mass ratios does not exceed 5%\
  \ of the results in the impact categories. 3.5 Background data The current version\
  \ of the software system for Life Cycle Assessment /GaBi 6/ was used to model the\
  \ life cycle. All the background data sets relevant for the manufacture and disposal\
  \ were obtained from diverse GaBi databases and from /ecoinvent/ (v.2.2). The data\
  \ sets contained in the databases are documented online. 3.6 Data quality The background\
  \ data sets from the GaBi database used for the assessment are from the reference\
  \ year 2012. An ecoinvent data set, which was more than 10 years old, also was used.\
  \ It is however, currently considered the most suitable data set available and,\
  \ based on empirical values, is generally said to be conservative. Data for the\
  \ examined products were captured by means of analyses of internal production and\
  \ environmental data, of LCA-relevant data within the supply chain and relevant\
  \ data for energy supplies which was provided by the manufacturers. The collected\
  \ data were checked for plausibility and consistency; a good representative sample\
  \ is assumed. 3.7 Period under review The LCA is based on data collection from January\
  \ 2012 to December 2012. 3.8 Allocation Credits resulting from energy recovery of\
  \ packaging materials waste (Module A5) and of laminate flooring at End of Life\
  \ (Module C3) were assigned in Module D. 3.9 Comparability Basically, a comparison\
  \ or an evaluation of EPD data is only possible if all the data sets to be compared\
  \ were created according to /EN 15804/ and the building context, respectively the\
  \ product-specific characteristics of performance, are taken into account. 6 Environmental\
