  \ Resilient Flooring This product contains substances listed in the /REACH/ Candidate\
  \ List of Substances of Very High Concern for Authorisation\u201D (SVHC) (27.06.2018)\
  \ exceeding 0.1 percentage by mass: no Reference service life A calculation of the\
  \ reference service life according to /ISO 15686/ is not possible. The service life\
  \ of resilient floor coverings depends on the correct installation taking into account\
  \ the declared use classification and the adherence to cleaning and maintenance\
  \ instructions. A minimum service life of 20 years can be assumed /BNB/, technical\
  \ service life can be considerably longer. LCA: Calculation rules Declared Unit\
  \ Name Value Unit Declared unit 1 m 2 Conversion factor to 1 kg 0.26 - Mass reference\
  \ 3.9 kg/m\xB2 The declared unit refers to 1 m2 produced floor covering. Output\
  \ of module A5 'Assembly' is 1 m 2 installed floor covering. System boundary Type\
  \ of EPD: Cradle-to-grave System boundaries of modules A, B, C, D: A1-A3 Production:\
  \ Energy supply and production of the basic material, auxiliary material, transport\
  \ of the material to the manufacturing site, emissions, waste water treatment, packaging\
  \ material and waste processing up to the landfill disposal of residual waste (except\
  \ radioactive waste). Benefits for generated electricity and steam due to the incineration\
  \ of production waste are aggregated. A4 Transport: Transport of the packed floor\
  \ covering from factory gate to the place of installation. A5 Installation: Installation\
  \ of the floor covering, processing of installation waste and packaging waste up\
  \ to the landfill disposal of residual waste (except radioactive waste), the production\
  \ of the amount of floor covering that occurs as installation waste including its\
  \ transport to the place of installation. Generated electricity and steam due to\
  \ the incineration of waste are listed in the result table as exported energy. Preparing\
  \ of the floor and adhesives are beyond the system boundaries and not taken into\
  \ account. B1 Use: Indoor emissions during the use stage. After the first year,\
  \ no product related VOC emissions are relevant due to VOC decay curves of the product.\
  \ B2 Maintenance: Cleaning of the floor covering for a period of 1 year: Vacuum\
  \ cleaning - electricity supply Wet cleaning - water consumption, production of\
  \ the cleaning agent, waste water treatment. The declared values in this module\
  \ have to be multiplied by the assumed service life of the floor covering in the\
  \ building in question. B3 - B7: The modules are not relevant and therefore not\
  \ declared. C1 De-construction: Energy consumption of the de-construction machine.\
  \ C2 Transport: Transport of the floor covering waste to a landfill or to the municipal\
  \ waste incineration plant (MWI). C3 Waste processing: C3-1: Landfill disposal needs\
  \ no waste processing. C3-2: Impact from waste incineration (plant with R1>0.6),\
  \ generated electricity and steam are listed in the result table as exported energy.\
  \ C4 Disposal C4-1: Impact from landfill disposal, C4-2: The floor covering waste\
  \ leaves the system in module C3-2, D Recycling potential: D-A5: Benefits for generated\
  \ energy due to incineration of packaging and installation waste (incineration plant\
  \ with R1 > 0.6), D-1: Benefits for generated energy due to landfill disposal of\
  \ floor covering waste at the end-of-life, D-2: Benefits for generated energy due\
  \ to incineration of floor covering waste at the end-of-life (incineration plant\
  \ with R1 > 0.6), Comparability Basically, a comparison or an evaluation of EPD\
  \ data is only possible if all the data sets to be compared were created according\
  \ to /EN 15804/ and the building context, respectively the product-specific characteristics\
  \ of performance, are taken into account. Background data are taken from the /GaBi\
