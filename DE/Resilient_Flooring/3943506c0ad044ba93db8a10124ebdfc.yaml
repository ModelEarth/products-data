description: The Pulastic Multifunctional Sports Floor is a high-end sports floor
  providing outstanding comfort and safety for intensive training and competition
  combined with outstanding resistance to mechanical loads. The sports floor is approved
  according to the /EN 14904/ standard in category M3. Moreover, the sports floor
  is approved by the /F.I.B.A./ (International Basketball Federation) and /I.H.F./
  (International Handball Federation). It is manufactured under /ISO 9001/ for quality
  management and /ISO 14001/ for environmental care. The material consists of a special
  granulate rubber shock-pad of approximately 14 mm thickness, a pore sealing and
  levelling layer, in which a tear-proof polyurethane layer is applied which is embedded
  in a cast between two layers of flexible polyurethane. Then there is a seamless
  polyurethane wearing surface, finished with a special slightly structured durable
  mat-coat finish and line marking, is applied. For the placing on the market of the
  product in the EU/EFTA (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011
  (CPR) applies. The product needs a Declaration of Performance taking into consideration
  /Alternative 1a. EN 14904 Surfaces for sports areas - Indoor surfaces for multi-sports
  use - specification. ICS 97.220.10. For the application and use the respective national
  provisions apply.

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis document applies to the Pulastic Multifunctional\
  \ Sports Floor system manufactured by Sika Nederland B.V. in 7418 CK Deventer, Netherlands.\
  \ The lifecycle assessment data are based on production data from 2017 collected\
  \ by Sika Technology AG. The declared results refer to the product with the maximum\
  \ layer thickness. It can be assumed that products with lower thickness and mass,\
  \ but manufactured out of the same components, will show the same or less environmental\
  \ impact. \nSystem boundary: \nType of EPD: Cradle to Grave.\n\n\nThe system boundaries\
  \ of the EPD follow the modular structuring system described by /EN 15804/. The\
  \ LCA takes into account the following modules:\n\n A1-A3: Manufacture of pre-products\
  \ and the product, packaging, ancillary materials, processing (recycling) of secondary\
  \ materials, transport to the factory, production including energy supply and emissions,\
  \ waste handling (incineration of production waste, waste water treatment).\nA4:\
  \ Transport to the building site.\nA5: Installation in the building (including disposal\
  \ of packaging waste (incineration, recycling, reuse) and emissions during installation),\
  \ production and transport of the amount of shock-pad that occurs as installation\
  \ waste.\nB2: Maintenance including electricity for vacuum cleaner, water and cleaning\
  \ agent as well as waste water treatment.\nB5: Refurbishment (production, transport\
  \ application of the materials included in the facelift, electricity, emissions\
  \ and waste processing) - (B5/1: incineration scenario, B5/2: landfill scenario,\
  \ B5/3: recycling scenario).\nC1: Deconstruction and demolition (energy for the\
  \ machinery to remove the floor).\nC2: Transport to waste-processing facility.\n\
  C3: Waste processing for incineration (C3/1) or recycling (C3/3).\nC4: Impact from\
  \ landfill disposal (C4/2).\nD: Potential for reuse, recovery and/or recycling as\
  \ net flows and benefits.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\n\
  Various mixing machines are used for manufacturing the different materials. In these\
  \ mixing machines the various raw materials are combined and mixed for a certain\
  \ period. After mixing, the material is filled into cans, which are provided with\
  \ a label with the product name. After mixing and filling, the products are packed\
  \ in accordance with all laws and regulations. The Pulastic Multifunctional Sports\
  \ Floor is manufactured under /ISO 9001/ for quality management. \nTechnical data:\
  \ \nProduct Data \n16 Classic colours and 16 Design colours are available as per\
  \ manufacturer's colour brochure. \nDeclared unit: \nThis declaration applies to\
  \ 1 m2 of Pulastic Multifunctional Sports Floor, with a thickness of 19.5 mm. The\
  \ study period is 40 years."
