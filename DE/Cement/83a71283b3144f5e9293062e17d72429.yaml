description: 'The declared product of HIT-CT 100 is a two component system. The resin
  component (component A) comprises a resin based on methacrylate as well as mineral
  and cement like fillers. The curing agent component (component B) comprises peroxide
  hardener, water and mineral fillers. Mixing the two components A and B in the static
  mixer initiates the curing (hardening) reaction of both binder systems. During the
  curing phase, a very strong bond is formed between the organic and inorganic binder
  matrix.

  The hybrid system formed during cement and resin curing results in a crosslinked
  duromer with desired design properties (high bond strengths within a short curing
  time) and particular long-term stability. Composite foils are used for the two-component
  foil pack of HIT-CT 100. This kind of packaging serves the following purposes: waste
  volume reduction, easy storage and transport, and less packaging material.'

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe declared product is one kilogram of\
  \ reaction resin product in the mixing ratio of the two components necessary for\
  \ processing. The packaging is also included in the calculation. The declared unit\
  \ is stated in [kg].\nThis document refers to the injectable mortar HIT-CT 100 with\
  \ its packaging. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment, specific data\
  \ were collected from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI AG. Since\
  \ the production of this product has only just started in 2023, no annual average\
  \ consumption can be used. The input and output flows used in this calculation were\
  \ therefore measured directly by the manufacturer for this production process for\
  \ a comparable product. \nSystem boundary: \nType of EPD: From cradle to gate with\
  \ modules C1-C4 and D. The following information modules are defined as system boundaries\
  \ in this study:\n\nProduction stage (A1- A3):\n- A1, raw material extraction,\n\
  - A2, transport to the manufacturer,\n- A3, production.\n\nEnd of life (C1- C4):\n\
  - C1, deconstruction/demolition,\n- C2, transport,\n- C3, waste treatment ,\n- C4,\
  \ disposal.\n\nReuse, recovery and recycling potential (D).\n\nIn order to accurately\
  \ capture the indicators and environmental impacts of the declared unit, a total\
  \ of 8 information modules are considered. The information modules A1 to A3 describe\
  \ the material provision, the transport to the production site, as well as the production\
  \ processes of the product itself.\n\nThe primary products are sourced from the\
  \ European Union. The transport is carried out by lorry. The following flow charts\
  \ illustrate the underlying production process.\n\nIllustration 1: Information module\
  \ A1 to A3 of product (part 1)\n\n\nIllustration 2: Information moduled A1 to A3\
  \ of product (part 2)\n\n\nIllustration 3: Information moduled A1 to A3 of packaging\n\
  \nIn the information modules C1 to C4, the deconstruction or demolition from the\
  \ building, the transport to waste disposal, the waste treatment and disposal of\
  \ the product are recorded. Furthermore, reuse, recovery and recycling potentials\
  \ are reported in information module D.\n\n# Technology Description And Included\
  \ Processes\n\nAll raw materials are sourced from Europe. The transport is exclusively\
  \ by truck. Certain materials go through the required production steps at the supplier,\
  \ before the final production of the injection mortar in Kaufering. Chemical mortars\
  \ are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and a hardener. The production\
  \ of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling process of the\
  \ respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent union\
  \ to a two-component system (container). During the mixing process control technology\
  \ is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to specification.\
  \ In the next step both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line\
  \ in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally\
  \ the single components are united in one container. The two-pack foil bags are\
  \ packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shippd. The manufacturing plant of\
  \ HIT-CT 100, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft f\xFCr Befestigungstechnik, Hiltistr.\
  \ 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The guideline\
  \ defines international standards for quality and process management. The following\
  \ flowcharts illustrate the underlying information modules. \nDeclared unit: \n\
  The declared product is an injection mortar from HILTI AG with the designation HIT-CT\
  \ 100. The declared unit refers to 1 kg of reaction resin product in the mixing\
  \ ratio of the two components required for processing. The packaging, related to\
  \ 1 kg of reaction resin product, is additionally included in the calculation with\
  \ 0.118 kg. The following table shows the data of the declared unit."
