description: Penguard Express MIO is a two component amine cured epoxy coating. It
  is a fast drying, micaceous iron oxide (MIO) pigmented, high solids, high build
  product. The declared product is specially designed for new construction where short
  dry to handle and over coating times are required. It can be used as primer, mid
  coat, finish coat or as single coat system in atmospheric environments. Penguard
  Express MIO is suitable for properly prepared carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum
  and concrete substrates. It can be applied at sub zero surface temperatures. It
  is suitable for structural steel and piping to be exposed to highly corrosive environments,
  C5I or C5M (ISO 12944-2). Recommended for offshore environments, refineries, power
  plants, bridges, buildings and mining equipment. For information on Green Building
  Standard credits, see "Additional Information" on page 4. The material composition
  of the declared mixed product is given below

  \ for the raw material composition. Specific data for the product composition and\
  \ raw material amounts has been provided by the manufacturer and represents the\
  \ production of the declared product. Production site data was collected in 2015.\
  \ Representative data from ecoinvent v3.2 was used for other processes. The data\
  \ quality for the material input in A1 is presented in tabular form. Allocation:\
  \ The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming\
  \ energy, water and waste production in-house is primarily allocated equally among\
  \ all products through mass allocation. Specific allocation was performed for certain\
  \ waste flows according to information provided by the site manager. VOC emissions\
  \ have been allocated entirely to the production of solvent based paints. Effects\
  \ of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in\
  \ which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material\
  \ is allocated to this analysis. Cut-off criteria: All major raw materials and essential\
  \ energy is included. The production process for raw materials and energy flows\
  \ with very small amounts (less than 0.1 % dry matter) are not included. In total,\
  \ more than 99% of the material input is included. These cut-off criteria do not\
  \ apply for non-energy related emissions (such as wastes, hazardous materials and\
  \ substances).\n\n## Source Data Notes\nISO 14025:2010 Environmental labels and\
