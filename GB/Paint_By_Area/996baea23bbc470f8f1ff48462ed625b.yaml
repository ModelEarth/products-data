description: Jotafloor EPC 300 Plus is a two component amine cured high volume solid,
  low VOC epoxy coating. It is a self smoothing, easy to apply product, leaving a
  seamless surface. With Jotafloor Non Slip aggregates, enhanced slip resistance is
  possible. To be used as finish coat in atmospheric environments. The declared product
  is designed for a wide range of floors with various levels of mechanical exposure.
  Recommended for workshops, carparks, garages, factories, laboratories, aircraft
  hangars and plant rooms where nonslip properties are required. For information on
  Green Building Standard credits, see "Additional Information" on page 4. The material
  composition of the declared mixed product is given below

  \ The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming\
  \ energy, water and waste production in-house is primarily allocated equally among\
  \ all products through mass allocation. Specific allocation was performed for certain\
  \ waste flows according to information provided by the site manager. VOC emissions\
  \ have been allocated entirely to the production of solvent based paints. Effects\
  \ of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in\
  \ which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material\
  \ is allocated to this analysis. Cut-off criteria: All major raw materials and essential\
  \ energy is included. The production process for raw materials and energy flows\
  \ with very small amounts (less than 0.1 % dry matter) are not included. In total,\
  \ more than 99% of the material input is included. These cut-off criteria do not\
  \ apply for non-energy related emissions (such as wastes, hazardous materials and\
  \ substances).\n\n## Source Data Notes\nISO 14025:2010 Environmental labels and\
