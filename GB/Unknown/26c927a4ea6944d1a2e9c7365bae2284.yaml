lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nSteel enamel baths and shower trays, exclusively\
  \ manufactured in the Ahlen plant of Franz Kaldewei GmbH & Co. KG, Germany. \nSystem\
  \ boundary: \nThe LCA for the enamel steel baths and shower trays considers the\
  \ life cycle phases of Production (A1-A3) as well as recycling of packaging during\
  \ installation (Module A5). Disposal in terms of re-use, treatment and landfilling\
  \ (C4) is also considered in this study. An analysis of the modules under review\
  \ gives rise to credits and loads beyond the system boundary (Module D), especially\
  \ as a result of the steel recycling potential which is fully allocated to this\
  \ module.  \n\nTransport to the building (Module A4), dismantling at the End-of-Life\
  \ (C1), transport for the End-of-Life (C2) and the use stage (Module B) are not\
  \ considered in this study.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\
  \nThe manufacturing process for enamelled baths and shower trays is subdivided into\
  \ the following processes: - Manufacture of the raw baths and trays - Cleaning the\
  \ raw baths and trays - Manufacture of the enamel frits - Manufacture of the enamel\
  \ slips and - Enamelling. The process steps associated with these sub-processes\
  \ are outlined as follows: 1. Manufacture of the raw baths and trays The raw baths\
  \ and trays are manufactured in automatic continuous press lines in the following\
  \ process stages: \u2022 Deep-drawing: The baths and trays acquire the required\
  \ shape by deep-drawing electrostatically-oiled steel blanks in 2-part drawings\
  \ with forces of 8,000 \u2013 10,000 kN. \u2022 Processing the raw bath/tray: After\
  \ deep-drawing, the outlets, overflows and sometimes holes for handles are punched\
  \ and the base frame brackets mounted. \u2022 Working the edges of the raw bath/tray:\
  \ The edge contours of the raw baths/trays are produced by folding over and trimming\
  \ the edges in several operations. 2. Cleaning the raw baths and trays The raw baths\
  \ and trays are cleaned in a continuous, automated facility according to the following\
  \ sub-steps: \u2022 Degreasing the raw baths and trays: After they have been produced,\
  \ the raw baths and trays are covered with a film of corrosion-protection oils,\
  \ deep-drawing oils and abraded metal particles from the deep-drawing process which\
  \ are washed off by spraying them with alkali tenside solutions. \u2022 Acidic rinsing\
  \ of the raw baths and trays: Any impurities remaining on the raw baths and trays\
  \ after degreasing are washed off by spraying with a strongly-diluted solution of\
  \ sulphuric acid. \u2022 Alkali rinsing of the raw baths and trays: A temporary\
  \ rust-inhibiting layer is formed on the raw baths and trays by spraying them with\
  \ a slightly alkaline amine solution. 3. Manufacture of the enamel frits Enamel\
  \ frits are for the glass granulates used for enamelling and are produced in the\
  \ following sub-steps: \u2022 Formulation and mixing of the raw materials for the\
  \ glass: The raw materials for the glass are weighed and mixed in mixing plants.\
  \ \u2022 Smelting the enamel frit: The raw material mixtures for the glass are smelted\
  \ in batch-type smelters for 2-3 hours at temperatures of between 1,100 and 1,300\
  \ \xB0C. When the smelting process is complete, the glass melt is poured into water\
  \ to quench it and thus granulated. \u2022 Drying the enamel frit: The surface water\
  \ adhering to the grains of the enamel frit is partially removed by drying. 4. Manufacture\
  \ of the enamel Slips Enamel slips are for the suspensions of glass granulate in\
  \ water used for enamelling and are produced in the following sub-steps: \u2022\
  \ Formulation of the raw materials for the slip: Solid raw materials are weighed\
  \ and filled into batch-operated mills along with the liquid, volumetrically-dosed\
  \ raw materials. \u2022 Grinding process: The raw materials for the slip are ground\
  \ to enamel slips in drum mills. \u2022 Preparation of the enamel slips: After the\
  \ grinding process, the enamel slips are pumped through systems of sieves and magnetic\
  \ separators in order to separate off coarse mechanical and magnetic metallic impurities.\
  \ 5. Enamelling Enamelling is the production of a layer of glass on a metal surface\
  \ and is carried out in the following sub-steps: \u2022 Coating the cleaned raw\
  \ bath or tray with enamel slip: Robots in automatic spray booths spray the fronts\
  \ and backs of the raw baths and trays with enamel slips. \u2022 Drying the enamel\
  \ coating: The water remaining in the enamel coating is evaporated in continuous\
  \ drying ovens. \u2022 Firing the enamel coating at 820-860 \xB0C: The enamel coating\
  \ is fired onto the bath or tray in continuous ovens so that the coating on the\
  \ upper side of the bath or tray has a thickness of 200-300 \u03BCm. \u2022 Packaging:\
  \ An automated system applies the company logo to the enamelled baths and trays\
  \ before they are packaged. \nTechnical data: \nBaths and shower trays consist of\
  \ a deep-drawn bath/tray body made of steel suitable for enamelling which is coated\
  \ on both sides with base enamel and on the front with finishing enamel. The following\
  \ chart depicts sample data on two shower trays and three baths. \n\nFor KALDEWEI\
  \ products, the ratio of bath/tray surface to the projection surface is determined\
  \ as follows: \n\n\nFor baths: \n\nbath surface [m\xB2] ~ 1.5 x projection surface\
  \ [m\xB2] + 0.5 \n\nFor shower trays lower than 140 mm:  \n\ntray surface [m\xB2\
  ] ~ 1.14 x projection surface [m\xB2] + 0.06 \n\nFor shower trays with a depth of\
  \ 140 mm:  \n\ntray surface [m\xB2] ~ 1.24 x projection surface [m\xB2] + 0.13 \n\
  \nFor shower trays with a depth of 250 mm:  \n\ntray surface [m\xB2] ~ 1.45 x projection\
  \ surface [m\xB2] + 0.24 \n\n\nDepending on the respective model, features and construction\
  \ specifications on the test bench, Kaldewei baths and shower trays comply with\
  \ individual or several sound insulation standards. These include DIN 4109, DIN\
  \ 4109/A1, VDI 4100 SST I-III and SIA 181. All sound insulation certificates are\
  \ available on www.kaldewei.de. \nDeclared unit: \nIn accordance with the PCR guidelines\
  \ for building-related products and services for the building product category of\
  \ steel enamel baths (PCR Bath 2013), this Environmental Product Declaration refers\
  \ to the declared unit of 1 m\xB2 surface of an average product representing all\
  \ steel enamel baths and shower trays produced by Kaldewei GmbH& Co. KG. \n\n1 m\xB2\
  \ surface of an average product weighs 16.9 kg. The enamel-to-surface ratio is comparable\
  \ for various products: The gross density is the same for the various products.\
  \ The enamel coating is 200 \u2013 300 \xB5m thick. 0.4 kg packaging material is\
  \ also declared. \n\nNo accessory parts are declared."
