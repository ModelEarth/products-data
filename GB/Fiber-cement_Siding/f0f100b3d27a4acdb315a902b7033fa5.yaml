lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis declaration represents the production\
  \ of 1 m of Swisspearl Slates fibre cement board at the production site located\
  \ in Beroun, Czech Republic. Product specific data are based on production values\
  \ from the year 2021. \nSystem boundary: \nThe modules considered in this EPD follow\
  \ a cradle-to-grave assessment: A1-A5, B1-B7, C1-C4, D. \nA1 -The system boundary\
  \ includes the provision and processing of raw materials. These include in particular\
  \ cement, plastic fibres, pulp and packaging materials.\n\nA2 -The transports to\
  \ the manufacturer were specifically collected for all starting materials. \n\n\
  A3 -The production includes all in-plant energy consumption (gas + electricity),\
  \ as well as water used in the production process, and production waste.\n\nA4 -The\
  \ transport, part of the construction process, is an average of the total distance\
  \ of all products delivered to the point of installation. This is calculated to\
  \ be 1964 km.\n\nA5 -All environmental impacts associated with the disposal of packaging\
  \ handled at the construction site are accounted for. It is assumed incinerated\
  \ at an incineration plant. Furthermore, environmental impacts associated with trucks\
  \ and fuel for the construction installation are included.\n\nB1-B7 modules are\
  \ included, however, no significant environmental impact is associated with the\
  \ use phase of the product.\n\nC1 -Accounts for the environmental impacts associated\
  \ with dismantling and demolition of the fibre cement boards. Fuel used for demolition\
  \ equipment and transport on site vehicles.\n\nC2 -Transportation of the discarded\
  \ products from the construction site to a landfilling site. The transport is estimated\
  \ to be 100 km in an average truck.\n\nC3- The fibre cement boards are sent to landfill\
  \ and therefore there are no environmental impacts associated with waste processing\
  \ of materials flows intended for reuse, recycling or energy recovery. \n\nC4 -Environmental\
  \ impacts associated with the processes at the landfill.\n\nD -The fibre cement\
  \ boards are sent to landfill after use. The product has therefore no impact during\
  \ this stage and no associated environmental impacts. The boards are expected to\
  \ be reusable over time, but this is not included in this assessment. Incineration\
  \ credits have been considered, and resulting credits for thermal and electrical\
  \ energy are declared.\n\nBackground data and data quality\nModelling of the production\
  \ of 1m2 of Swisspearl Slates is done with GaBi Software System and Database for\
  \ Life Cycle Engineering. The model has been developed by Sphera Solutions GmbH.\
  \ Each background dataset has been reviewed on geographical, technological, and\
  \ temporal scale. \n\nTechnological: All primary and secondary data are modelled\
  \ to be specific to the technology mixes under study. Proxy data are used where\
  \ technology-specific data are unavailable. The technological representativeness\
  \ is considered to be good.\n\nGeographical: All primary and secondary data are\
  \ collected specific to the countries/regions under study. Where country/region-specific\
  \ data are unavailable, proxy data are used. The geographical representativeness\
  \ is considered to be good.\n\nTemporal: All primary data collected is based on\
  \ the year 2021. All secondary data come from the GaBi 2020.1 databases and are\
  \ representative for the years 2020-2025. Temporal representativeness is considered\
  \ to be very good.\n\nAllocation in foreground data\nThe production process does\
  \ not deliver any co-products. Therefore, the applied model does not contain any\
  \ allocation. \n\nAllocation for waste materials\nPre-processing waste (plastics)\
  \ is sent to a waste incineration plant. The resulting electrical and thermal energy\
  \ is credited in module A1. For the waste incineration plant an R1-value of above\
  \ 0.6 is assumed.\n\nCut-off criteria\nAll raw materials used, utilized thermal\
  \ energy, and electric power consumption of the production process are considered\
  \ in this assessment. This means that all material and energy flows contributing\
  \ less than 1% are considered.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\
  \nManufacturing Swisspearl Slates are manufactured with Hatschek technology. A very\
  \ thin slurry of water, binder and fibres is mixed and introduced into each of the\
  \ vats of the Hatschek machine. The rotating sieve cylinder in the vats collects\
  \ a thin layer of solid material that is further dewatered as it is transferred\
  \ to a felt and further on to an accumulating format roller. At the required thickness,\
  \ the accumulated layers are automatically cut into the required product size, and\
  \ transferred into the pre-curing area. After pre-curing, the products are stored\
  \ under continued control of temperature and humidity. The main constituents of\
  \ Swisspearl Slates are as followed: Portland Cement: 75-80% Inert filler: 15-25%\
  \ Cellulose: 2-4% PVA: 1-3% Paint: 0-2%Material explanation Portland Cement: Manufactured\
  \ according to /DIN EN 197-1/ from limestone, marl and sand. The material is crushed,\
  \ dried, calcinated to clinker and ground to cement. Inert filler: a filler to optimize\
  \ deformation properties and material bonding. Cellulose Fibres (0.5-3mm): To assure\
  \ collection of powder during filtration. PVA fibres (4-6mm): Synthetic Polyvinyl\
  \ alcohol fibre used as reinforcement.There are no substances of very high concern\
  \ (SVHC) present in the product according to according to Regulation (EC) No.1907/2006\
  \ (REACH) \nTechnical data: \nThe technical specifications of Swisspearl Slates\
  \ can be seen in the following table: \nDeclared unit: \nIn this EPD the declared\
  \ unit is defined as the production of 1m2 of Swisspearl Slates with a thickness\
  \ of 4mm, an expected lifetime of 50 years or higher, and its related impacts over\
  \ the cradle to grave life-cycle modules."
