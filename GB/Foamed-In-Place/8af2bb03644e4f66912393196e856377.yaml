lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nProduct line flexen\xAE Exzenterblock Compact\
  \ Thermal insulation products for building equipment and industrial insulations\
  \ made of Polythene-based, closed-cell foam pipe insulation with a robust protective\
  \ coating (PEF) according to EN14313. This declaration\nis an Environmental Product\
  \ Declaration according to ISO14025 describing the specific environmental performance\
  \ of the product produced in Belgium at the\nsite of Eynatten. \nSystem boundary:\
  \ \nThe Data collection refers to the yearly production in 2021\nModule A1 to A3:\n\
  The LCA\ncalculation covers the production of the raw materials, transport of these\
  \ to\nthe plant, the mixing of raw materials according to the respective recipes,\n\
  manufacturing of the foam product and packaging for dispatch. All production\ntakes\
  \ place exclusively in Eynatten, Belgium. \nModule A4: \nThe type of transport included\
  \ in the LCA model is a truck mix Euro Cargo 0-6 with diesel fuel. As the product\
  \ is foam with a comparatively low density, the product volume is the limiting factor\
  \ on loading. flexen\xAE Exzenterblock Compact is rarely\nthe only product loaded\
  \ in trucks, they are usually grouped with other products of higher density according\
  \ to the place of destination. trucks has been set to 10% of the mass payload capacity.\n\
  Module A5: \nThe LCA calculation covers the production of the raw materials, transport\
  \ of these to\nthe plant, the mixing of raw materials according to the respective\
  \ recipes,\nmanufacturing of the foam product and packaging for dispatch. All production\n\
  takes place exclusively in Eynatten, Belgium. \nModule B1-B7:\nThe foam insulation\
  \ products do not require maintenance, replacement or refurbishment while in use.\
  \ The information modules B1 \u2013 B7 are not declared. Although the insulation\
  \ of the piping flexen\xAE Exzenterblock Compact contributes to a significant reduction\
  \ of CO2 emissions from the heating or cooling equipment, this is not taken into\
  \ account\nin this LCA. It should, however, be taken into account in the calculation\
  \ of the environmental impacts of the complete heating and cooling systems or of\
  \ the\ncomplete building\nModule C1:\nAs for the installation of the product, the\
  \ disassembly is done manually and does not require any specific equipment. Disassembly\
  \ is generally carried out at the same time as the replacement or removal of sanitary\
  \ pipes. Consequently, there are no impacts associated with C1. \nModule C2:\nTransport\
  \ at the end-of-life stage is modelled as a Euro Cargo 0-6 mix truck with diesel\
  \ fuel. The average distance to either mechanical recycling is assumed to be 100\
  \ km. \nModule C3: \nThe scenario that has been retained for this Life Cycle Assessment\
  \ is the 100% recycling \nModule C4: \nAs flexen\xAE Exzenterblock Compact is fully\
  \ recyclable, the legislation is pushing more in this direction and the overall\
  \ pressure on plastic recycling is growing, therefore the scenario with 100% recycling\
  \ is considered. \nModule D: \nThe end-of-life scenarios for packaging material\
  \ and product do not deliver any benefits for the next system. The recycling of\
  \ cardboard is a closed cycle with the production process. The flexen\xAE Exzenterblock\
  \ Compact foam is fully recyclable and can be used as a direct one-for-one substitute\
  \ for virgin PE-LD granulates, with only minor additive additions.\n\n# Technology\
  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nThe manufacturing process consists of a\
  \ continuous extrusion. Solid pellets of thermoplastic resin are fed to a melting\
  \ zone in which the resin is melted, to form a flowable thermoplastic mass. The\
  \ thermoplastic mass is then metered to a mixing zone where the thermoplastic mass\
  \ is thoroughly mixed with a blowing agent under pressure. The mixture of thermoplastic\
  \ resin and blowing agent is then forced through a die, which imparts a shape to\
  \ the thermoplastic mass, into a zone of lower pressure, such as atmospheric pressure.\
  \ The blowing agent expands to form the cells of the foam and the thermoplastic\
  \ foam is cooled through an inline water cooler. The protection coating \"skin\"\
  \ is applied by co-extrusion. The \"skin\" is made with solid pellets of thermoplastic\
  \ resin and some additives, which is, with the help of an extruder, applied around\
  \ the foam. There is not a foaming agent used in this case. The die is positioned\
  \ around the \"naked\" foam and deposes a small thickness (\xB1 0.1 mm) of PE film\
  \ on the foam. At the end of this process the profiles are cut at dimension. Quality\
  \ assurance : The manufacture is certified ISO 9001 for the quality management.\
  \ The product corresponds to the product standard EN 14313 and has a Declaration\
  \ of Performance according to the DOP W\xDCRTH_LE_0870509015_01_M_flexen_Exzenterblock_Compact\
  \ (seewww.wuerth.de) \nDeclared unit: \nThe declaration refers to 1 m of produced\
  \ insulation product. For the LCA calculations, as the product is foam and have\
  \ some tolerances, the density declared is the average between the product categories.\
  \ The thermal conductivity coefficient (Lambda-value) and R-value per 25 mm thickness\
  \ per product brand is provided below as additional information and support for\
  \ installers."
