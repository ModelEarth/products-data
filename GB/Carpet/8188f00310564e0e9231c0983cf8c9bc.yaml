lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nA Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted\
  \ based upon production data collected from Shaw Contract (Shaw Europe, Ltd.), Plant\
  \ SQ manufacturing facility (Blackaddie Road, Sanquhar, DG46DB), located in Scotland,\
  \ UK. Production data was collected for EcoWorx\xAE Carpet Tile (US Made UK Market)\
  \ with EcoSolution Q\xAE, Solution Q\xAE, or Solution Q Extreme\xAE Face Fibre,\
  \ for the period of one year, from January to December 2021.\n\nThis EPD is cradle-to-gate\
  \ with options in scope with additional modules A4, A5, B1 and B2. The EPD is created\
  \ in accordance to the specifications of EN 15804+A2.\n\nThe EPD was generated with\
  \ the help of Envision LCA Tool, version 1. The tool has not been manipulated in\
  \ calculating impact results. The current version of the tool is maintained, saved,\
  \ and stored for 10 years to be used for revision and re-traceability purposes.\
  \ \nSystem boundary: \nThe type of EPD is Cradle-to-Gate with options modules C1\u2013\
  \ C4, module D, and additional modules. The additional modules are A4, A5, B1 and\
  \ B2.\n\nThe modules considered in the life cycle assessment and environmental product\
  \ declaration, based on the products entire life cycle, are described as follows:\n\
  \nProduction Stage:  \n\nModule A1 - Provision of Raw Materials.\nModule A2 - Transport\
  \ of Raw Materials.\nModule A3 - Manufacturing.Construction/Installation Stage:\n\
  \nModule A4 - Transportation by truck of the product to the construction site in\
  \ Europe. \nModule A5 - Installation of the carpet, treatment of cutting waste (landfill)\
  \ and packaging waste (landfill, recycling, and incineration). The production of\
  \ the amount of carpet that occurs as installation waste is also included along\
  \ with its transport to the place of installation. Biogenic carbon that is stored\
  \ in the wooden pallets and cardboard (packaging) is released as carbon dioxide\
  \ emissions into the air at the end of life in module A5.Use Stage:\n\nModule B1\
  \ - Indoor emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the first few months\
  \ after installation.\nModule B2 - Carpet cleaning per year, including vacuuming\
  \ (electricity consumption) and hot water cleaning (electricity and water consumption,\
  \ as well as waste water treatment).\nModule B3 - Repair (module not relevant).\n\
  Module B4 - Replacement (module not relevant).\nModule B5 - Refurbishment (module\
  \ not relevant).\nModule B6 - Operational Energy Use (module not relevant).\nModule\
  \ B7 - Operational Water Use (module not relevant). End of Life Stage:\nThree scenarios\
  \ have been evaluated:\nScenario 1: the EcoWorx\xAE (US Made UK Market) carpet is\
  \ 100% disposed of in a landfill.\nScenario 2: the EcoWorx\xAE (US Made UK Market)\
  \ carpet is 100% incinerated. \nScenario 3: 40% of EcoWorx\xAE (US Made UK Market)\
  \ carpets are incinerated and the remaining 60% are landfilled. This assumption\
  \ is based on the carpet disposal rates in Europe mentioned in the study conducted\
  \ by Deutsche Umwelthilfe in 2017 (Umwelthilfe, 2017) and the European Commission\
  \ in 2013 (Commission, 2013).\n\nModule C1 - The carpet is de-constructed manually\
  \ and no additional environmental impact is caused.\nModule C2 - Transport of the\
  \ carpet waste to a landfill or to the municipal waste incineration plant.\nModule\
  \ C3 - Impacts from thermal treatment disposal (C3/2 and C3/3).\nModule C4 - Impacts\
  \ from landfill disposal (C4/1 and C4/3).Module D includes benefits from energy\
  \ recovery via treatment of packaging materials and incineration of carpets at their\
  \ end of life (D/1, D/2 and D/3), as well as the burdens of balancing the secondary\
  \ material content in modules A1 and A3 via the net-scrap approach.\n\n# Technology\
  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nThis EPD applies to carpet tile with EcoWorx\xAE\
  \ backing system together with EcoSolution Q\xAE, Solution Q\xAE, or Solution Q\
  \ Extreme\xAE Nylon face fibre. EcoWorx\xAE is a commercial carpet tile, for use\
  \ as a floor covering in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines. The carpet tile\
  \ consists of Shaw's unique face fibre, Nylon 6, manufactured with 1% recycled material\
  \ on EcoWorx\xAE backing system, a polyolefin-based compound which also includes\
  \ recycled materials and a fibreglass secondary reinforcement layer. \nTechnical\
  \ data: \nThe technical specifications of the product are listed on the products\
  \ specification sheet, found at www.shawcontract.com. This product meets the requirements\
  \ of the harmonized European Norm (hEN): EN14041:2004A/C:2006. Declarations of performance\
  \ related to fire, electrostatic, formaldehyde emissions, and slip resistance can\
  \ be found on the products specification sheet. \nDeclared unit: \nThe declaration\
  \ refers to the declared unit of 1 m of installed carpet tile."
