lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe manufacturer declaration applies to\
  \ a group of products with a maximum total pile weight of 1010 g/m2. LCA results\
  \ for products of the same construction but with a maximum total pile weight of\
  \ 400 g/m2 can be taken from the corresponding tables of the annexe. Specific data\
  \ for every product within the declared group of products in relation to its total\
  \ pile weight can be calculated by using equation 1 given in the annexe (see annexe\
  \ chapter: 'General Information on the annexe'). \n\nThe carpet is manufactured\
  \ at the Milliken production site in Wigan, United Kingdom.\n\nThe declaration is\
  \ only valid in conjunction with a valid GUT-PRODIS license of the product. \nSystem\
  \ boundary: \nType of EPD:Cradle-to-gate with options, module C1-C4, module D, and\
  \ additional modules A4, A5, B1, B2.\n\nSystem boundaries of modules A, B, C, D:\n\
  Modules C3, C4 and D are indicated separately for three end-of-life scenarios:\n\
  1 - landfill disposal\n2 - municipal waste incineration\n3 - recovery in a cement\
  \ plant\n\nA1-A3 Production:\n\nEnergy supply and production of the basic material,\
  \ processing of secondary material, auxiliary material, transport of the material\
  \ to the manufacturing site, emissions, waste water treatment, packaging material\
  \ and waste processing up to the landfill disposal of residual waste (except radioactive\
  \ waste). Benefits for generated electricity and steam due to the incineration of\
  \ production waste are aggregated.\n\nBiogenic carbon that is stored in renewable\
  \ material (packaging paper) is taken into account as well as the associated uptake\
  \ of carbon dioxide from the air from which this biogenic carbon originates.\n\n\
  A4 Transport:\nTransport of the packed textile floor covering from factory gate\
  \ to the place of installation.\n\nA5 Installation:\nInstallation of the textile\
  \ floor covering, processing of installation waste and packaging waste up to the\
  \ landfill disposal of residual waste (except radioactive waste), the production\
  \ of the amount of carpet that occurs as installation waste including its transport\
  \ to the place of installation.\n\nGenerated electricity and steam due to the incineration\
  \ of waste are listed in the result table as exported energy.\n\nBiogenic carbon\
  \ stored in renewable materials in packaging paper is released into the air as carbon\
  \ dioxide emissions at the end of the life cycle in module A5.\nPreparation of the\
  \ floor and auxiliary materials (adhesives, fixing agents, PET connectors) are beyond\
  \ the system boundaries and not taken into account.\n\nB1 Use:\nIndoor emissions\
  \ during the use stage. After the first year, no product-related Volatile Organic\
  \ Compound (VOC) emissions are relevant due to known VOC decay curves of the product.\n\
  \nB2 Maintenance:\nCleaning of the textile floor covering for a period of 1 year:\n\
  Vacuum cleaning \u2013 electricity supply\nWet cleaning \u2013 electricity, water\
  \ consumption, production of the cleaning agent, waste water treatment.\nThe declared\
  \ values in this module have to be multiplied by the assumed service life of the\
  \ floor covering in the building in question.\n\nB3 - B5:\nThe modules are not relevant\
  \ within the assumed reference service life of 10 years.\n\nB6 - B7:\nNo energy\
  \ and water input are required for the operation of the carpet in the use stage.\
  \ The modules are not relevant and not declared.\n\nC1 De-construction:\nThe floor\
  \ covering is de-constructed manually and no additional environmental impact is\
  \ caused.\n\n\nC2 Transport:\nTransport of the carpet waste to a landfill, to the\
  \ municipal waste incineration plant (MWI) or to the waste collection facility for\
  \ recycling.\n\nC3 Waste processing:\nC3-1: Landfill disposal needs no waste processing.\
  \ \nC3-2: Impact from waste incineration (plant with R1>0.6), generated electricity\
  \ and steam are listed in the result table as exported energy.\n\nC3-3: Collection\
  \ of the carpet waste for recovery in the cement industry, waste processing (granulating),\
  \ transport to the cement plant, emissions from the incineration. The biogenic carbon\
  \ that is stored in the renewable materials of the floor covering is released into\
  \ the air as carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nC4 Disposal:\nC4-1: Impact from landfill\
  \ disposal,\n\nC4-2: The carpet waste leaves the system in \n\nmodule C3-2,C4-3:\
  \ The pre-processed carpet waste leaves the system in module C3-3.\n\nD Recycling\
  \ potential:\nCalculated benefits result from materials exclusive secondary materials\
  \ (net materials).\nD-A5: Benefits for generated energy due to incineration of packaging\
  \ and installation waste (incineration plant with R1 > 0.6), \nD-1: Benefits for\
  \ generated energy due to landfill disposal of carpet waste at the end of life,\n\
  D-2: Benefits for generated energy due to incineration of carpet waste at the end-of-life\
  \ (incineration plant with R1 > 0.6),\nD-3: Benefits for saved fossil energy and\
  \ saved inorganic material due to recovery of the carpet in a cement plant.\n\n\
