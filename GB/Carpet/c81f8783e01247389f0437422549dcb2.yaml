lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe manufacturer declaration applies to\
  \ tufted wall-to-wall carpet with a SBR based foam backing, a pile material of PP\
  \ with a maximum total pile weight of 1275 g/m2. The products are produced in Kib\xE6\
  k, Denmark and coated in Bording, Denmark.\nLCA results for products with a maximum\
  \ total pile weight of 1030 g/m2 can be taken from the corresponding tables of the\
  \ annexe. Specific data for every product within the declared group of products\
  \ in relation to its total pile weight can be calculated by using equation 1 given\
  \ in the annexe (see annexe chapter: 'General Information on the annexe'). The declaration\
  \ is only valid in conjunction with a valid GUT-PRODIS license of the product. \n\
  System boundary: \nType of EPD: \n\nCradle-to-gate with options, module C1-C4, module\
  \ D, and additional modules A4, A5, B1, B2.\n\nSystem boundaries of modules A, B,\
  \ C, D:\n\nModules C3, C4 and D are indicated separately for three end-of-life scenarios:\n\
  \n1 - landfill disposal\n2 - municipal waste incineration\n3 - recovery in a cement\
  \ plant\n\nA1-A3 Production:\n\nEnergy supply and production of the basic material,\
  \ processing of secondary material, auxiliary material, transport of the material\
  \ to the manufacturing site, emissions, waste water treatment, packaging material\
  \ and waste processing up to the landfill disposal of residual waste (except radioactive\
  \ waste). Benefits for generated electricity and steam due to the incineration of\
  \ production waste are aggregated. \nBiogenic carbon that is stored in renewable\
  \ material (packaging paper) is taken into account as well as the associated carbon\
  \ dioxide uptake from the air from which this biogenic carbon comes.\n\nA4 Transport:\n\
  \nTransport of the packed textile floor covering from factory gate to the place\
  \ of installation.\n\nA5 Installation:\n\nInstallation of the textile floor covering,\
  \ processing of installation waste and packaging waste up to the landfill disposal\
  \ of residual waste (except radioactive waste), the production of the amount of\
  \ carpet that occurs as installation waste including its transport to the place\
  \ of installation.\n\nGenerated electricity and steam due to the incineration of\
  \ waste are listed in the result table as exported energy. \n\nBiogenic carbon that\
  \ is stored in renewable materials in packaging paper is released as carbon dioxide\
  \ emissions into the air at the end of life in module A5.\n\nPreparation of the\
  \ floor and auxiliary materials (adhesives, fixing agents, PET connectors) are beyond\
  \ the system boundaries and not taken into account.\n\nB1 Use:\n\nIndoor emissions\
  \ during the use stage. After the first year, no product-related Volatile Organic\
  \ Compound (VOC) emissions are relevant due to known VOC decay curves of the product.\n\
  \nB2 Maintenance:\n\nCleaning of the textile floor covering for a period of 1 year:\n\
  \nVacuum cleaning \u2013 electricity supply\n\nWet cleaning \u2013 electricity,\
  \ water consumption, production of the cleaning agent, waste water treatment.\n\n\
  The declared values in this module have to be multiplied by the assumed service\
  \ life of the floor covering in the building in question.\n\nB3 - B5:\n\nThe modules\
  \ are not relevant within the assumed reference service life of 10 years.\n\nB6\
  \ - B7:\n\nNo energy and water input are required for the operation of the carpet\
  \ in the use stage. The modules are not relevant and not declared.\n\nC1 De-construction:\n\
  \nThe floor covering is de-constructed manually and no additional environmental\
  \ impact is caused.\n\nC2 Transport:\n\nTransport of the carpet waste to a landfill,\
  \ to the municipal waste incineration plant (MWI) or to the waste collection facility\
  \ for recycling.\n\n\n\nC3 Waste processing:\n\nC3-1: Landfill disposal needs no\
  \ waste processing. \n\nC3-2: Impact from waste incineration (plant with R1>0.6),\
  \ generated electricity and steam are listed in the result table as exported energy.\n\
  \nC3-3: Collection of the carpet waste for recovery in the cement industry, waste\
  \ processing (granulating), transport to the cement plant, emissions from the incineration.\n\
  \nC4 Disposal\n\nC4-1: Impact from landfill disposal,\n\nC4-2: The carpet waste\
  \ leaves the system in \n\nmodule C3-2,\n\nC4-3: The pre-processed carpet waste\
  \ leaves the system in module C3-3.\n\nD Recycling potential:\n\nCalculated benefits\
  \ result from materials exclusive secondary materials (net materials).\n\nD-A5:\
  \ Benefits for generated energy due to incineration of packaging and installation\
  \ waste (incineration plant with R1 > 0.6), \n\nD-1: Benefits for generated energy\
  \ due to landfill disposal of carpet waste at the end-of-life,\n\nD-2: Benefits\
  \ for generated energy due to incineration of carpet waste at the end-of-life (incineration\
  \ plant with R1 > 0.6),\n\nD-3: Benefits for saved fossil energy and saved inorganic\
  \ material due to recovery of the carpet in a cement plant.\n\n# Technology Description\
  \ And Included Processes\n\nTufted wall-to-wall carpet having a pile material of\
  \ polypropylene and a SBR based foam backing."
