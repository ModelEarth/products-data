  \ the life cycle of the product any hazardous substance listed in the \u201CCandidate\
  \ List of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) for authorization1\u201D has been\
  \ used in a percentage higher than 0,1% of the weight of the product. In Annex I\
  \ the results of the environmental performance of the life cycle of the product\
  \ in the thicknesses of 50 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm are showed. 1 http://echa.europa.eu/chem_data/authorisation_process/candidate_list_table_en.asp\
  \ 3\n\n## LCA Notes\nLCA model, aggregation of data and environmental impact are\
  \ calculated from the TEAM\u2122 software 5.2. CML v 4.2 impact method has been\
  \ used, together with DEAM (2006) and Ecoinvent 2.3 databases to obtain the inventory\
  \ of generic data. Raw materials and energy consumption, as well as transport distances\
  \ have been taken directly from the manufacturing plant of Isover Saint Gobain Spain\
  \ in 2014. The tables below summarize in detail the results of the LCA, corresponding\
  \ to a product thickness of 39 mm. This thickness, although it does not correspond\
  \ to a real product, corresponds to an R = 1 K.m\xB2.W -1 facilitating in this way\
  \ the comparison between different insulating materials. This EPD\xAE includes the\
  \ next thicknesses: 40 mm, 50 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm. Based in the\
  \ reference PCR, a reference value has been selected (R=1 m2.K for a thickness of\
  \ 40 mm), thickness to which all the results are normalized. In Annex I the environmental\
  \ performance of the 50 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm thicknesses are showed.\
