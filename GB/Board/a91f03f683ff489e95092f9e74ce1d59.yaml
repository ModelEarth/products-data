description: "Xtratherm PIR foam is a polyisocyanate based insulation foam for use\
  \ in solid insulation products. It is not sold as a foam alone, but is faced with\
  \ a range of facers to create insulation boards, to be sold under the product range\
  \ names of Xtratherm Thin-R, Thin-R Plus and Xtroliner. These are insulation products\
  \ for use in a wide range of building applications including walling, cavity walls,\
  \ roofing, framing, and solid and suspended flooring. The Xtratherm PIR insulation\
  \ boards are made in a range of foam thicknesses (25 - 160mm) and using various\
  \ combinations of different facers, to make the products listed in the table below:\
  \ Product range Product Thin-R Pitched Roof (XT / PR) Thin-R Flat Roof (FR / BGM)\
  \ Thin-R Cavity Wall (XT / CW) Thin-R Plus Cavity Wall Plus (XT / CWP) Thin-R Underfloor\
  \ (XT / UF) Thin-R Plus Cavity Therm (CT / PIR) Thin-R Timber Frame (XT / TF) Thin-R\
  \ Plus Cavity Therm Flex (CT/Flex) Thin-R Hyfloor (XT / HYF) Xtroliner Cavity Wall\
  \ (XO / CW) Thin-R Sarking (XT / SK) Xtroliner Floor (XO / UF) Thin-R Thermal Liner\
  \ (XT / TL) Xtroliner Framing Board (XO / FB) Thin-R Flat Roof (FR / ALU) Xtroliner\
  \ Pitched Roof (XO / PR) Thin-R Flat Roof (FR / MG) Xtroliner Soffit (XO / ST) EPD\

  \ Rev 0.0 Page 3 of 8 \xA9 BRE Global Ltd, 2017 NOTE: The LCA study modelled the\
  \ highest thickness of foam sold within the products covered, of 160mm, plus facings\
  \ (on both sides) of the facer type which was considered to be the worst in terms\
  \ of its individual, per m2, LCA results. Therefore, the results for this product\
  \ represent (for the majority of impact categories), the worst case scenario, and\
  \ thus cover all products listed. Technical Information Technical properties of\
  \ the Xtratherm insulation boards vary depending on the product type. For properties\
  \ of each product covered by this EPD, please see the Xtratherm\u2019s website:\

  \ Aluminium foil based facer, 0.33\n\n## LCA Notes\nDeclared product in EPD = 160\
  \ mm thickness\nConversion to thickness at RSI = 1, based on 0.0215 W/mK = 21.5\
  \ mm\nGWP in EC3 = GWP of  EPD * 21.5/160\n\nMass = declared foam mass * 21.5/160\
  \ + foil facer mass \n=5.12* 21.5/160 +.33\n\nNote that this does NOT account for\
  \ proportional impacts of aluminum facer material when scaling. Actual impacts are\
  \ likely higher than displayed here for this reason.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nThe\
  \ supporting LCA study was carried out using BRE LINA v2.0 using manufacturer specific\
  \ data provided by Xtratherm for the production period of the 12 months of 2016.\
  \ Both the UK and Irish production sites\u2019 data was used to model the Xtratherm\
  \ PIR foam and the weighted average (based on production output) was carried forwards\
  \ to model the representative faced product. Both Xtratherm sites produced other\
  \ insulation products in addition to their PIR insulation products so allocation\
  \ was applied to site wide values for energy, packaging, water, non-production waste,\
  \ and wastewater, on a volume of foam production basis. No allocation of production\
  \ waste was required as this is recorded for individual foam types. No allocation\
  \ of raw material inputs was required as total site raw material usage for all PIR\
  \ foam made over the production period was used. Secondary data has been drawn from\
  \ the BRE LINA database v2.0.31 and the background LCI datasets are based on ecoinvent\
  \ v3.2. EPD Number: 000226 Date of Issue:17 September 2018 Expiry Date 16 September\
