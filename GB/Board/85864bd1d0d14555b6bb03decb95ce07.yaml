description: "Insulation boards made of Neopor\xAE Plus BMB are expandable polystyrenes\
  \ (EPS) with polymer flame retardants (Polymer FR). \u201CBMB\u201D stands for \u201C\
  Biomass Balance\u201D products. The Biomass Balance method uses renewable raw materials\
  \ such as bio-naphtha or biogas in the manufacture of chemical base products by\
  \ the production network of BASF along with fossil raw materials. The organic content\
  \ is then allocated to certain BASF sales products such as Neopor\xAE Plus BMB granulate\
  \ in accordance with a certified method /T\xDCV S\xFCd Standard CMS 71/. BMB products\
  \ display the same quality as non-BMB products as the product formulation is identical\
  \ to that of its fossil equivalent. The BMB approach applied by BASF supports the\
  \ use of renewable raw materials which leads to savings in fossil resources and\
  \ lower greenhouse gas emissions. The biomass used requires proof of sustainability\
  \ in the form of a certificate of a standard recognised by the Renewable Energy\
  \ Directive. Neopor\xAE Plus BMB granulate is manufactured from biogas extracted\
  \ from kitchen waste. The biogas used is certified in accordance with the /REDcert/\
  \ system."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis EPD describes an insulation board made\
  \ of Neopor\xAE Plus BMB (Biomass Balance approach). The granulate is manufactured\
  \ at the BASF SE site in Ludwigshafen and further processing as boards is carried\
  \ out by Karl Bachl Kunststoffverarbeitung GmbH & Co. KG in R\xF6hrnbach. \nSystem\
  \ boundary: \nType of EPD: Cradle-to-Gate \u2013 with options \n\n\nModules considered\
  \ in the Life Cycle Assessment: \n\n\nA1: Raw material supply\n\nA2: Transport to\
  \ manufacturer\n\nA3: Manufacturing\n\nA4: Transport to site \n\nA5: Assembly\n\n\
  C2: Transport to waste treatment\n\nC4: Disposal\n\nD:   Reuse, recovery or recycling\
  \ potential \n\nThe analysis of the product life cycle comprises the production\
  \ and transport of base materials, manufacturing of the product and packaging materials,\
  \ and is declared in Modules A1-A3. Production residue from A3 such as blanks or\
  \ edge profiles are reused in the production process. This was taken into consideration\
  \ when calculating the LCA parameters. \n\nTransport of the product is considered\
  \ in Module A4. Disposal of the packaging materials as well as the production, transport\
  \ and disposal of offcuts incurred on the construction site are considered in Module\
  \ A5. Energy gained from incineration processes are declared in Module D, beyond\
  \ the system boundary. \n\n\nThe use phase is not taken into consideration in the\
  \ LCA calculations. \n\n\nThe EoL scenarios include transport to the End-of-Life\
  \ stage (C2) and disposal of the product via incineration (C4). \n\n\nThe LCA for\
  \ biomethane from kitchen waste comprises all of the relevant process steps from\
  \ the extraction of raw materials to manufacture (Cradle-to-Gate). Kitchen waste\
  \ does not have any economic value and is therefore considered clear of any encumbrances.\
  \ It loses its waste status as soon as it is converted into biogas. \n\n\nThe absorption\
  \ of biogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is considered in line with the\
  \ biogenic carbon content in the BMB product (A1-A3). During disposal of the product,\
  \ biogenic CO2 emissions are released again which are considered in C4.\n\n# Technology\
  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nProduction of insulation boards made of\
  \ Neopor\xAE Plus BMB entails a multi-stage production process. The granulate is\
  \ initially produced at the BASF SE site in Ludwigshafen followed by the foaming\
  \ process at the Karl Bachl Kunststoffverarbeitung GmbH & Co. KG site in R\xF6hrnbach.\
  \ The conversion process of EPS granulate to foamed insulation boards consists of\
  \ the following manufacturing stages: pre-foaming, interim storage and foaming.\
  \ During the pre-foaming stage, the granulate is foamed with the aid of steam and\
  \ the blowing agent pentane. Subsequently, the expanded granulate is stored in air-permeable\
  \ silos. Thanks to the diffusing air, the EPS foam particles receive the necessary\
  \ stability for further processing. The most commonly used method of producing insulation\
  \ boards is block foaming followed by cutting. For this purpose, the EPS foam particles\
  \ are filled into cuboid block moulds and foamed with steam at 110 \xB0C to 120\
  \ \xB0C. After a short cooling time, the blocks are demoulded and deposited. Then\
  \ the blocks are cut into boards using mechanical or thermal cutting equipment.\
  \ Production waste is fully reused for the production of primary material. \nTechnical\
  \ data: \nPerformance data of the product in accordance with the Declaration of\
  \ Performance with respect to its essential characteristics according to /EN 13163:2012+A1:2015\
  \ \u2013 Thermal insulation materials for buildings \u2013 Factory-made expanded\
  \ polystyrene (EPS) products \u2013 Specification/ \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared\
  \ unit is 1 m\xB3 insulation board made of Neopor\xAE Plus BMB. The conversion factors\
  \ are listed in the following table."
