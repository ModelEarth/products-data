lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nIsolaparma produces ISOLPARMA RFM that is\
  \ a high performance insulation board manufactured from closed cell expanded rigid\
  \ polyurethane foam, covered on both sides by multilayer facers based on aluminium.The\
  \ data have been provided by the only Isolparma factory that is located in Padova\
  \ (Italy) for the year 2019. \nSystem boundary: \nThis life cycle assessment for\
  \ the production of the polyurethane insulation board considers the life cycle from\
  \ the supply of raw materials to the manufacturer\xB4s gate (cradle-to-gate with\
  \ options). It also includes the transport to the construction site, the installation\
  \ and the end-of-life stage of the used PU thermal insulation board. The life cycle\
  \ is split into the following individual phases:\nA1 - Raw material formulation\
  \ \nA2 - Raw material transport\nA3 - Production of the insulation board and packaging\
  \ material\nA4 - Transport to the construction site\nA5 - Emissions and cutting\
  \ losses during installation and packaging disposal\nC2 - Transport to end of life\n\
  C3/C4 - End-of-Life: waste management (thermal recovery, landfill)\nD - Benefits\
