lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nIsolparma srl produces RF7 HP that is a\
  \ high performance insulation board manufactured from closed cell expanded rigid\
  \ polyurethane foam, covered on both sides with saturated fiber glass. The data\
  \ have been provided by the only Isolparma factory that is located in Padova (Italy)\
  \ for the year 2017. The owner of the declaration shall be liable for the underlying\
  \ information and evidence; the IBU shall not be liable with respect to manufacturer\
  \ information, life cycle assessment data and evidences. \nSystem boundary: \nThis\
  \ life cycle assessment for the production of the polyurethane insulation board\
  \ considers the life cycle from the supply of raw materials to the manufacturer\xB4\
  s gate (cradle-to-gate with options). It also includes the transport to the construction\
  \ site, the installation and the end-of-life stage of the used PU thermal insulation\
  \ board. The life cycle is split into the following individual phases:\n A1 - Raw\
  \ material formulation \n A2 - Raw material transport\n A3 - Production of the insulation\
  \ board and packaging material\n A4 - Transport to the construction site\n A5 -\
  \ Emissions and cutting losses during installation and packaging disposal\n C2 -\
  \ Transport to end-of-life\n C3/C4 - End-of-Life: waste management (thermal recovery\
  \ and landfill)\n D - Benefits and loads beyond system boundary\n\n# Technology\
