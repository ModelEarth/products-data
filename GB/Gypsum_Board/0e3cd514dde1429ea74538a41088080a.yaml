  \ blend of natural gypsum and scrap material. During the life cycle of the product\
  \ any hazardous substance listed in the \u201CCandidate List of Substances of Very\
  \ High Concern (SVHC) for authorization\u201D has not been used in a percentage\
  \ higher than 0.1% of the weight of the product. The verifier and the program operator\
  \ do not make any claim nor have any responsibility of the legality of the product.\
  \ 2.6 Manufacture 15mm Gyproc DuraLine is manufactured using a continuous production\
  \ process. Manufacturing process flow diagram The initial materials are homogenously\
  \ mixed to form a gypsum slurry that is spread via hose outlets onto a paper liner\
  \ on a moving belt conveyor. A second paper liner is fed onto the production line\
  \ from above to form the plasterboard. The plasterboard continues along the production\
  \ line where it is finished, dried, and cut to size. Construction waste from A5\
  \ stage is recycled back into the manufacturing process wherever possible. 3 British\
  \ Gypsum plants are managed through ISO9001 certified Quality Management Systems.\
  \ 2.7 Environment and health during manufacture At British Gypsum, Health and Safety\
  \ is a core value. The Company\u2019s aim is always to be injury-free. A target\
  \ of zero accidents at work for employees, visitors and contractors is set by the\
  \ business. British Gypsum is managed to BS OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and\
  \ Safety Management Systems. To ensure that the Company\u2019s objectives are achieved,\
  \ documented safety management systems are employed at each operational site and\
  \ within the central functions. These include a systematic identification of hazards,\
  \ assessment of the risks and the development of safe systems of work to eliminate\
  \ or reduce any risks to an acceptable level. Audits and inspections are used to\
  \ monitor standards of safety management, adherence to the law and Company procedures.\
  \ British Gypsum plants are managed through ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management\
  \ Systems. Saint- Gobain believes that climate change is one of the major threats\
  \ to this generation and future generations. The organisation is committed to being\
  \ part of the solution and consider two important distinct areas: Firstly, to reduce\
  \ carbon emissions which come from buildings, in particular as they are used. It\
  \ is currently estimated that between 35-40% of total UK & Irish greenhouse gas\
  \ emissions come from buildings; and secondly, in reducing direct and indirect emissions\
  \ which come from the operational footprint and activities. The building sector\
  \ produces one third of solid waste each year, and consumes half of Europe\u2019\
  s natural resources. Moving away from a culture of take-use-dispose is one of the\
  \ biggest challenges construction faces, and one of the biggest opportunities. To\
  \ embrace a circular economy in construction action is needed in a number of areas,\
  \ in particular: Focussing on deconstruction - not demolition, encouraging selective\
  \ sorting of waste streams, moving away from landfill - including government legislation\
  \ to make landfilling waste the least attractive option, training and education\
  \ of contractors and other construction professionals, and making much greater use\
  \ of secondary resources. 2.8 Product processing/Installation General It is important\
  \ to observe appropriate health and safety legislation when working on site, i.e.\
  \ personal protective clothing and equipment, etc. The following notes are intended\
  \ as general guidance only. In practice, consideration must be given to design criteria\
  \ requiring specific project solutions. Handling Manual off-loading of"
