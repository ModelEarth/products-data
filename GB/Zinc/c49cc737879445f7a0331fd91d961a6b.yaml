description: The basis of the RHEINZINK alloy is electrolytic high-grade fine zinc
  in accordance with EN 1179, with a 99.995 % degree of purity. Added to this are
  small amounts of titanium and copper based on EN 988. In addition to other factors,
  the alloy composition is not only of importance for the technological material properties
  of RHEINZINK but also for the colour of its patina.

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThe Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried\
  \ out according to DIN ISO 14040 et sqq. Specific data from the company RHEINZINK\
  \ in Datteln, Germany, and from the data base \u201CGaBi 5\u201D were used. The\
  \ LCA was carried out for the manufacturing phase of the products, taking into account\
  \ all background data such as raw material production and transports (\u201Ccradle\
  \ to gate\u201D). The use phase of the titanium zinc sheets is divided into several\
  \ application areas: roofing applications, roof drainage and facade claddings. The\
  \ treatment for the titanium zinc sheets was modeled in re-melting furnaces for\
  \ the end of life phase. The thereby resulting credit of extracted zinc is counted\
  \ as replacement for primary zinc. \nSystem boundary: \nType of the EPD: cradle\
  \ to gate - with options\n\n\nIn this study, the product stage information modules\n\
  \n\nA1, A2, and A3 are considered. These modules include production of raw material\
  \ extraction and processing (A1), processing of secondary material input (A1), transport\
  \ of the raw materials to the manufacturer (A2), manufacturing of the product (A3)\
  \ and the packaging materials (A3).\n\n\nThe EoL of the product (Modul D) is also\
  \ included.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nThis data set\
  \ refers to 1 kg of RHEINZINK-prePATINA blue-grey and graphite-grey: pre-weathered\
  \ coil and sheet material. Components of RHEINZINK-alloy Special-High-Grade zinc\
  \ 99.995% (Z1 according to DIN EN 1179): \u2264 99,835% Copper: 0,08 - 1,0% Titanium:\
  \ 0,07 - 1,2% Aluminium: \u2264 0,015% Structure of the manufacturing process: The\
  \ manufacturing process comprises eight steps. Pre-alloy: To improve the quality,\
  \ and for energy-saving reasons, a pre-alloy is produced at 760 \xB0C in an induction\
  \ crucible stove (meltdown of fine zinc, copper, titanium and aluminium). The pre-alloy\
  \ blocks produced contain the titanium and copper portions of the subsequent rolled\
  \ alloy. Melting: The pre-alloy blocks and fine zinc are melted together in large\
  \ melting stoves (induction channel stoves) at 500 \u2013 550 \xB0C and mixed together\
  \ completely with induction currents. Casting: The final alloy is cooled down below\
  \ melting point with a closed water circuit in the casting machine, resulting in\
  \ a solid cast string. Rolling: There is a cooling distance between casting machine\
  \ and roller racks. The rolling is done by 5 roller pairs, so-called roller racks.\
  \ With adequate pressures the material thickness is reduced by up to 50% at each\
  \ of these roller racks. Simultaneously, the material is cooled and greased using\
  \ a special emulsion. Coiling: Subsequently, the readily rolled RHEINZINK is wound\
  \ up into coils of 20 tons weight (so-called big-coils). They are still at a temperature\
  \ of 100 \xB0C and are stored for further cooling. Stretching and cutting: The tensions\
  \ developed inside the RHEINZINK coils during rolling are \u201Cstretched-out\u201D\
  \ by a stretching-bending-straightening-process. Preweathering: After a cleaning\
  \ process the material is pickled and rinsed. The complete pickling process is carried\
  \ out in a continuously operating enclosed production process. Afterwards, a thin\
  \ temporary protection layer is applied. Quality control: Control by the manufacturer\
  \ and by T\xDCV Rheinland Group. Control of zinc material according to the QUALITY\
  \ ZINC list of requirements as set up by T\xDCV Rheinland Group. Quality management\
  \ control according to ISO 9001. Packaging of the titanium zinc sheets: The packaging\
  \ materials in use, paper/cardboard, polyethylene (PE foils), polypropylene (PP\
  \ foils) and steel, are recyclable (non-reusable wooden pallets, reusable wooden\
  \ and metal pallets). If gathered separately, return in Germany is organized by\
  \ INTERSEROH which collects the packaging material at given sites with exchangeable\
  \ containers upon request and complies with legal regulations. The reusable wooden\
  \ and steel pallets are taken back and are reimbursed by RHEINZINK GmbH & Co. KG\
  \ and the wholesale trade (refund system). Basic principles: During transportation\
  \ and storage, RHEINZINK must be kept dry and ventilated to avoid the formation\
  \ of zinc hydroxide For the same reason, when laying RHEINZINK on wet surfaces or\
  \ in the rain it should be ensured that the base material does not have hygroscopic\
  \ properties. The thermic stretching of the material has to be taken into consideration\
  \ when handling/installing the product. Due to the typical brittleness of zinc under\
  \ cold conditions, the temperature of the product should be 10 \xB0C. In other cases,\
  \ adequate mechanical equipment should be used, e.g. hot air blasts. LCA results:\
  \ In this study, the product stage information modules A1, A2, and A3 are considered.\
  \ These modules include production of raw material extraction and processing (A1),\
  \ processing of secondary material input (A1), transport of the raw materials to\
  \ the manufacturer (A2), manufacturing of the product (A3) and the packaging materials\
  \ (A3). The EoL of the product (Modul D) is also included. The credits given in\
  \ Module D are a result of the 100% recyclability of each zinc-product. After the\
  \ scrap collection (a collection rate of 96% was assumed), zinc scrap is sent to\
  \ a re-melting process, where the scrap is converted to secondary zinc. The credit\
  \ for the zinc gained through re-melting is calculated with the dataset of the primary\
  \ production. \nTechnical data: \nThe following table gives conversion data from\
  \ product surface mass per unit area for the relevant product systems. \nDeclared\
  \ unit: \nThe declared unit is 1 kg of RHEINZINK-prePATINA\xAE \n\nblue-grey/graphite-grey."
