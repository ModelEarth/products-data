description: "/Product definition The declared product of HVU2 is a two-component\
  \ system. The resin component comprises a resin based on methacrylates as well as\
  \ mineral fillers. The curing agent component comprises of peroxide hardener. Mixing\
  \ the two components in the borehole initiates the curing (hardening) reaction of\
  \ both binder systems. During the curing phase a very strong bond is formed. The\
  \ system formed during curing results in a cross- linked duromer with desired design\
  \ properties (high 2 bond strengths within short curing time) and particular long-term\
  \ stability. Composite foils are used for the HVU2 capsule. This kind of packaging\
  \ serves the following purposes: waste volume reduction, easy storage and transport,\
  \ less packaging material. Through legislation and increased public awareness users\
  \ have increasingly become discerned towards the use of styrene and other highly\
  \ volatile components with their resulting unpleasant odour and low flash point\
  \ (flammability). The reaction resins used in all Hilti hybrid adhesives contain\
  \ no styrene, are practically odourless and have Environmental Product Declaration\
  \ Hilti AG - HVU2 a considerably higher flash point, i.e. higher than 100 \xB0C\
  \ in comparison to 34 \xB0C for styrene-based products. HVU2 is the ultimate performance\
  \ foil adhesive capsule for heavy-duty anchoring in concrete. For the placing of\
  \ the product on the market in the European Union European Free Trade Association\
  \ EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) the Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011\
  \ (CPR) applies. The product needs a declaration of performance taking into consideration\
  \ the following European Technical Approval ETA 16/0515 and the CE-marking. For\
  \ the application and use the respective national provisions apply."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis document refers to the adhesive capsule\
  \ HVU2  with its packaging. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment, specific\
  \ data were collected from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI AG. Data\
  \ from the year 2019 are used, which correspond to the annual average.\n\n\nThe\
  \ owner of the declaration shall be liable for the underlying information and evidence;\
  \ the IBU shall not be liable with respect to manufacturer information, life cycle\
  \ assessment data and evidences. The EPD was created according to the specifications\
  \ of EN 15804+A2. In the following, the standard will be simplified as EN 15804.\
  \ \nSystem boundary: \nThe type of the EPD is cradle to grave. The following information\
  \ modules are defined as system boundaries in this study: \n\n\nA1 \u2013 Raw material\
  \ supply:  \n\nProduction and packaging of the raw materials to be supplied to the\
  \ manufacturer. All processes are included from cradle to gate. \n\nA2 \u2013 Transport\
  \ (to manufacturing site):  \n\nTransportation of all the raw materials and their\
  \ packaging between their production site and the manufacturing site, for all transport\
  \ modes (sea, road).  \n\nA3 \u2013 Manufacturing:  \n\nProduction, supply and use\
  \ of energy sources at the manufacturing sites (electricity, biomass and natural\
  \ gas). Green electricity  from wind turbines is considered for the whole manufacturing\
  \ process. \n\nProduction and transport of production losses, final product packaging\
  \ and other inputs.  \n\nEnd-of-life of production waste (hazardous, non-hazardous\
  \ and recyclable), production losses and raw material packaging,  including waste\
  \ and losses transportation, processing and disposal. \n\nA4 \u2013 Transport (to\
  \ construction site) \n\nTransportation of packaged products from the manufacturing\
  \ site to the construction site, including potential in-betweens (retailer, workshop,\
  \ etc.). \n\nA5 \u2013 Installation-Construction \n\nElectricity consumption for\
  \ mixing. \n\nEnd-of-life of non-hazardous construction losses (cured mortar and\
  \ unsoiled packaging): including waste transportation, processing and disposal.\
  \ \n\nC1 \u2013 Deconstruction/demolition \n\nDiesel for building demolition.  \n\
  \nC2 \u2013 Transport (to waste processing) \n\nTransportation to waste processing\
  \ facility. \n\nC4\u2013 Waste disposal  \n\nTreatment and disposal of plastic to\
  \ sanitary landfill. \n\n\nFor the environmental impact, the use of green electricity\
  \ (stage A3) was calculated taking into account the residual electricity mix for\
  \ the remaining electricity. The proportion of the electricity demand covered by\
  \ green electricity in the total electricity demand is 100%.\n\n# Technology Description\
  \ And Included Processes\n\nMost raw materials are sourced in Europe. The transport\
  \ is exclusively by truck for the European raw materials, and by truck and by ship\
  \ for the others. Chemical mortars are usually two-component systems consisting\
  \ of a binder and a hardener. One of the base components of the binder is the reactive\
  \ resin which in the case of HVU2 is produced in Kaufering. The resin production\
  \ process is a chemical reaction of the corresponding educts to a basic resin with\
  \ subsequent mixing of the basic resin with different reactive diluents to a reactive\
  \ resin. This process is controlled and monitored by process control technology.\
  \ The production of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling\
  \ process of the respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent\
  \ union to a two-component system (packaging). Here as well process control technology\
  \ is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to the specification.\
  \ In the next step both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line\
  \ in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally\
  \ the single components are combined in one packaging unit. The two-pack foil bags\
  \ are packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped. The manufacturing plant\
  \ of HVU2, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft f\xFCr Befestigungstechnik, Hiltistr.\
  \ 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The guideline\
  \ defines international standards for quality and process management. The following\
  \ flowcharts illustrate the underlying production process. Illustration: Production\
  \ process of the reaction resin mixture Illustration: Production process of the\
  \ packaging \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared product is a HILTI adhesive capsule\
  \ HVU2. The declared unit refers to one kilogram of reaction resin product in the\
  \ required mixing ratio of the two components. The packaging of 0,224 kg/kg of product\
  \ is also included in the calculation. The following table shows the data of the\
  \ declared unit."
