description: 400Wp mono-crystalline solar photovoltaic module with back-contact conductivity,
  solid metal backing and thick connectors. The panels are designed to be installed
  on roofs or as stand-alone systems for local power production. The 2 other products
  covered by the PEP differ only in colour for the BLK product and the connector type
  for the COM product. As the differences between products is minor, no averaging
  has been performed. To produce their panels, SunPower sources silicon wafers from
  Norway and the US, which are sent to their factory in the Phillipines to produce
  the solar cells. These cells are then sent to their factory in Mexico, where they
  are assembled with the backsheet, frame and electrical connections to produce the
  finished solar module. Product specification

  \ module, from cradle-to-grave, with activities needed for a study period for a\
  \ defined reference service life (\u226580% of the labelled power output) Declared\
  \ unit: 1 m\xB2 of photovoltaic module - 1 m\xB2 = 226 Wp Data quality: Specific\
  \ data provided by SunPower for the year 2019. The procedures defined by the PCR\
  \ regarding the data quality have been respected according to the following criteria:\
  \ \u2022 Temporal factor: LCI data has been sourced from the database ecoinvent\
  \ 3.6, which was updated in 2019, and ELCD, updated in 2018. As such all LCI data\
  \ has been updated within the last 10 years All primary data dates from product\
  \ specific data collections from within the last 5 years. \u2022 Geographical factor:\
  \ Datasets appropriate to the location of the modelled flow have been selected when\
  \ available. Certain datasets have been modified to better reflect the specific\
  \ energy consumptions (see Appendix 2) of certain countries which are not available\
  \ in the database. When specific data for a country is not available and could not\
  \ be created, European processes were selected for flows attributed to Europe, and\
  \ Global or Rest of World flows were used for all other flows. \u2022 Technological\
  \ factor: Datasets have been selected according to the actual processes used by\
  \ the manufacturer. For generic products where no upstream data is available (e.g.\
  \ packaging), manufacturing has been modelled according current practices. System\
  \ boundary: The flow chart for the life cycle of SunPower Maxeon panels is shown\
  \ below. Allocation: The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of\
  \ ISO 14025. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated\
  \ equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production\
  \ of recycled materials allocated to the main product in which the material was\
  \ used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to\
  \ this analysis. Cut-off criteria: All major raw materials and all the essential\
  \ energy is included. The production process for raw materials and energy flows\
  \ that are included with very small amounts (<1%) are not included - this included\
  \ certain packaging materials used for the transport of components to the main production\
  \ facility. The infrastructure relating to the manufacturing facility has also been\
  \ exclude as it has negligeable impacts when considering the quantity of panels\
  \ produced. This cut-off rule does not apply for hazardous materials and substances.\
