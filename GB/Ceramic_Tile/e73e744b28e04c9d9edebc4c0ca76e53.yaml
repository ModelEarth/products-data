description: "Ceramic tiles, produced by Confindustria Ceramica's member companies\
  \ are shaped mainly by dry pressing (but also by extrusion), starting from natural\
  \ raw materials such as clay, feldspar, sand and kaolin. The main type of ceramic\
  \ tiles is porcelain stoneware, characterized by a very compact structure and high\
  \ performances. Other types include single fired tiles, like monoporosa, double\
  \ fired tiles, etc. For this study an average ceramic tile product, representative\
  \ of the whole production of Confindustria Ceramica\u2019s member companies, has\
  \ been identified and adopted."

  \ kg/m2 Conversion factor to 1 kg 0.0503 - 3.2 System boundary The entire life cycle\
  \ of the product is considered (Type of EPD: cradle- to- grave) and the module described\
  \ below are declared in this EPD. Modules A1-A3 include those processes that provide\
  \ energy and material input for the system (A1), transport up to the factory gate\
  \ of the plant (A2), manufacturing processes as well as waste processing (A3). 6\
  \ Environmental Product Declaration Confindustria Ceramica - Ceramic Tile Module\
  \ A4 includes the transport from the production site to the customer or to the point\
  \ of installation of the tiles. Module A5 considers all tile installation steps\
  \ (like adhesives consumption) also packaging waste processing (recycling, incineration,\
  \ disposal). Credits from energy substitution are declared in module D. During this\
  \ phase a ceramic material loss of 6,5% has been considered. Module B1 considers\
  \ the use of tiles. During the use of ceramic tiles no hazardous indoor emissions\
  \ are expected to occour. Module B2 includes the cleaning of the tiles. Provision\
  \ of water, cleaning agent for the cleaning of the tiles, incl. waste water treatment\
  \ are considered. Modules B3-B4-B5 are related to the repair replacement and refurbishment\
  \ of the tiles. If the tiles are properly installed no repair, replacement or refurbishment\
  \ processes are necessary. Modules B6-B7 consider energy use for operating building\
  \ integrated technical systems (B6) and operational water use for technical building-related\
  \ systems. No operational energy or water use are considered. Cleaning water is\
  \ declared under B2. Module C1 regards demolition and de-construction process of\
  \ the tiles from the building. Module C2 considers transportation of the discarded\
  \ tile to a recycling or disposal process. Module C3 considers every process (collection,\
  \ crushing process etc.) properly for recycling the tiles. Module C4 includes all\
  \ the landfill disposal processes, including pre-treatment and management of the\
  \ disposal site. Module D includes benefits from all net flows in the end-of-life\
  \ stage that leave the product boundary system after having passed the end-of-waste\
  \ stage. Loads from packaging incineration and resulted energy credits (electricity\
  \ and thermal energy) are declared within module D. 3.3 Estimates and assumptions\
  \ The modules from A5 to C4 are scenarios based on average data included into the\
  \ PCR created by the European Ceramic Tile Manufacturers' Federation /CET PCR 2014/.\
  \ For those materials, (glaze compost, colorant, and chemical additives) where no\
  \ primary data were available and an exact chemical composition (coming from datasheet)\
  \ was unknown an average composition was used, and assumptions were taken based\
  \ on common chemicals criteria. 3.4 Cut-off criteria All known inputs and outputs\
  \ were considered. 3.5 Background data Background data for the Life Cycle Modelling\
  \ have been taken from the last version /Gabi 7/ professional database (updated\
  \ to SP30, year 2016). Other sources for background data used are /ELCD/FEFCO/,\
  \ /Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook/, /Ceramic Glaze Handbook/, /European Ceramic\
  \ Tile Manufacturers' Federation/. 3.6 Data quality The period of validity of background\
  \ data from the thinkstep database lies between 2012 and 2018. Most information\
  \ (energy and water consumption, pollutant emissions powder atomized and ceramic\
  \ production) are measured or directly calculated at company level and declared\
  \ in the Italian IPPC document called AIA, that is specific and verified for each\
  \ plant involved in this study. Emissions of carbon dioxide (connected to carbonate\u2019\
  s oxidation) are collected using ETS (Emission Trading System) declaration. Detailed\
  \ data was obtained not only for raw material mixtures (collected with specific\
  \ company primary data) but also for colorants, frits and other raw materials used\
  \ in the glaze's manufacturing. The overall data quality can be considered good.\
