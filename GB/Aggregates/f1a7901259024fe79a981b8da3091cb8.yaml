  ## Source Data Notes

  Manufacturer-specific data from Addagrip Terraco Ltd covering a production period
  of 1 year [01/01/2017 to 31/12/2017] from the Uckfield site has been used for this
  EPD. There are no significant differences in the composition of all four products,
  therefore the EPD is derived from the Terrabase product data as it has the highest
  weight per m2. Materials, water and energy inputs are based on the Terrabase product
  as it has the highest weight per m2 and was chosen to represent the other three
  products as will have the highest impact. This is because the composition of each
  product is broadly similar. Energy, water and waste have been allocated on a mass
  basis for the Terrabase product.'
