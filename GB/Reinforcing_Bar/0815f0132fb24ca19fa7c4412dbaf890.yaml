description: "The declared product of HIT-MM PLUS is a two-component system. The resin\
  \ component (component A) comprises a resin based on methacrylate as well as mineral\
  \ and cementitious fillers. The curing agent component (component B) comprises peroxide\
  \ hardener, water and\nmineral fillers. Mixing the two components A and B in the\
  \ static mixer initiates the curing (hardening) reaction of both binder systems.\
  \ During the curing phase, a very strong bond is formed between the organic and\
  \ inorganic binder matrix. The hybrid system formed during cement and resin curing\
  \ results in a crosslinked duromer with desired design properties (high bond strengths\
  \ within a short curing time) and particular durability. Composite foils are used\
  \ for the two-component foil pack of HIT-MM PLUS. This kind of packaging serves\
  \ the following purposes: waste volume reduction, easy storage and transport, and\
  \ less packaging material. Through legislation and increased public awareness users\
  \ have increasingly become discerned towards the use of styrene and other highly\
  \ volatile components with their resulting unpleasant odour and low flash point\
  \ (flammability). The reaction resins used in all Hilti hybrid adhesives contain\
  \ no styrene, are practically odourless\nand have a considerably higher flash point,\
  \ i.e. higher than 100 \xB0C in comparison to 34 \xB0C for styrene based products.\
  \ HIT-MM PLUS is a premium performance injectable hybrid mortar with approvals for\
  \ rebar connections and heavy-duty anchoring."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis document refers to the injectable mortar\
  \ HIT-MM PLUS with its packaging. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment,\
  \ specific data were collected from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI\
  \ AG. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment, specific data were collected\
  \ from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI AG. Data from the years 2018\
  \ to 2021 are used, which correspond to the annual average. \nSystem boundary: \n\
  Type of EPD:\ncradle to gate with options.The following information modules are\
  \ defined as\nsystem boundaries in this study:\n\nProduction stage (A1- A3):\n\u2022\
  \ A1, raw material extraction,\n\u2022 A2, transport to manufacturer,\n\u2022 A3,\
  \ manufacture.\n\nEnd of life (C1- C4):\n\u2022 C1, dismantling/demolition,\n\u2022\
  \ C2, transportation,\n\u2022 C3, waste treatment,\n\u2022 C4, elimination.\n\n\
  Reuse, recovery and recycling potential (D)\n\nIn order to precisely record the\
  \ indicators and environmental impacts of the declared unit,\na total of 8 information\
  \ modules are considered. The information modules A1 to A3 describe the provision\
  \ of materials, the transport to the production site and the production processes\
  \ of the product itself.\n\nThe main products are sourced from the European Union\
  \ and Asia. Transport is by truck and ship. The following flow charts illustrate\
  \ the underlying production process.\n\n\nIllustration 1:\nInformation module A1\
  \ to A3 of product (part 1)\n\n\nIllustration 2:\nInformation module A1 to A3 of\
  \ product (part 2)\n\nIllustration 3:\nInformation module A1 to A3 of packaging\n\
  \n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nMost raw materials are sourced\
  \ in Europe. The transport is exclusively by truck for the European raw materials,\
  \ and by truck and by ship for the others. Chemical mortars are usually two-component\
  \ systems consisting of a binder and a hardener. One of the base components of the\
  \ binder is the reactive resin which in the case of HIT-MM PLUS is produced in Kaufering.\
  \ The resin production process is a chemical reaction of the corresponding educts\
  \ to a basic resin with subsequent mixing of the basic resin with different reactive\
  \ diluents to a reactive resin. This process is controlled and monitored by process\
  \ control technology. The production of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process\
  \ and a filling process of the respective single components (binder and hardener)\
  \ and their subsequent union to a two-component system (packaging). Here as well\
  \ process control technology is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds\
  \ according to the specification. In the next step both well-mixed components run\
  \ through an automized filling line in which each of the processed masses is filled\
  \ into a tubular foil bag. Finally the single components are combined in one packaging\
  \ unit. The two-pack foil bags are packed into cardboard boxes and then finally\
  \ shipped. The manufacturing plant of HIT-HY 170, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft\
  \ f\xFCr Befestigungstechnik, Hiltistr. 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified\
  \ according to ISO 9001. The guideline defines international standards for quality\
  \ and process management. \nDeclared unit: \nThe product declared here is an injection\
  \ mortar from HILTI AG with the designation HIT-MM PLUS. The declared unit refers\
  \ to 1 kg reaction resin product in the mixing ratio of the two components required\
  \ for processing. The packaging, based on 1 kg of reaction resin product, is also\
  \ calculated at 0.149 kg. The table below shows the data of the declared unit."
