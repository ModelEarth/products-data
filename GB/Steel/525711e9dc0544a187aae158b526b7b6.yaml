  \ 73% STEEL SCRAP General Manufacturing Specification STEEL SHOP Furnaces in steel\
  \ shop are loaded mostly by pre-selected scrap, pig iron, hot briquetted iron and\
  \ direct reduced iron depending on the mill. Metallic charge is melted by an electric\
  \ arc and by the use of chemical energy coming from natural gas, coal and oxygen.\
  \ Once the slag has been removed the liquid steel at a temperature of around 1 650\xB0\
  C is poured into the ladle. In the ladle furnace argon bubbling, addition of ferroalloys\
  \ and temperature recovering operations are carried out. Continuous casting transforms\
  \ liquid steel into round section solid bars for subsequent rolling. All production\
  \ processes in the steel shop are controlled by an integrated system including the\
  \ furnace power management, the furnace fumes emission, the addition of ferroalloys\
  \ to reach the required chemical composition, and the control of the casting parameters\
  \ until the cut-to-length of the bars. MANDREL ROLLING After passing through a rotary\
  \ hearth furnace, the bars are transferred to the hot rolling mill in order to carry\
  \ out the piercing process, thickness rolling and diameter sizing. The piercing\
  \ process transforms the hot bar into a hollow: the bar turns due to the movement\
  \ of two skewed opposing rollers. As a result of the internal tension generated,\
  \ a hollow is created in the center of the bar. Lamination takes place in order\
  \ to reach final dimensions in terms of length and thickness according to customer\u2019\
  s request. HEAT TREATMENTS In order to obtain the required mechanical properties,\
  \ heat treatment of normalizing or quenching and tempering are performed in different\
  \ facilities depending on tube dimensions. FINISHING Pipe is finalized in finishing\
  \ lines performing a combination of non destructive testing to guarantee high quality\
  \ of the product. Threading technologies provide API or PREMIUM"
