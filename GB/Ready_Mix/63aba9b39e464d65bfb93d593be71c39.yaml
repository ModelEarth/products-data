description: This EPD refers to 1 metric ton of Granulated Blast Furnace Slag. Granulated
  Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) is a by-product from the steel industry. In a blast furnace,
  iron contained raw materials is separated from the other minerals. These minerals
  are evacuated in the molten phase-out of the furnace, through a runner, into a granulator.
  The granulator is quenching the molten stream using water. GBFS is a sand-like material
  consisting mainly by CaO, SiO2, Al2O3 and MgO, combined in a vitreous structure
  thanks to the granulation. It is sold in this state by ArcelorMittal. The GBFS purchaser/user
  is finely grinding the material, either separately, or combined with other materials
  such as clinker. GBFS after grinding is a latent hydraulic binder used as a cement
  and concrete additive. The use and application of GBFS and ground GBFS is driven
  by cement and concrete standardization. EN 197-1 describes GBFS characteristics
  mandatory to produce CEM II, CEM III and CEM V, as well as allowed mixed compositions.
  EN 15167-1 describes ground GBFS characteristics mandatory to be used in concrete.
  EN 206 describes concrete allowed mix compositions with ground GBFS. For the use
  and application of the product, the respective national provisions at the place
  of use apply.

  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nThe declaration applies to 1 metric ton\
  \ of granulated blast furnace slag. The Life Cycle Assessment is based on data collected\
  \ from the ArcelorMittal integrated plants producing blast furnace slag as a co-product\
  \ of the steel manufacturing process, representing 100 % of the annual production\
  \ from 2019. Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) is a by-product from the steel\
  \ industry. In a blast furnace, iron contained raw materials is separated from the\
  \ other minerals. These minerals are evacuated in the molten phase-out of the furnace,\
  \ through a runner, into a granulator. The granulator is quenching the molten stream\
  \ using water. In the typical blast furnace process, hard coal (or coke), iron ore\
  \ and limestone are introduced into the top of the furnace. From the bottom, hot\
  \ air is blown into the furnace. Due to the combustion of carbon in the hottest\
  \ zone (at the bottom) carbon dioxide is formed. The carbon dioxide moves upwards,\
  \ and when in contact with carbon at lower temperatures, carbon monoxide is formed\
  \ (boudouard reaction). The carbon monoxide reacts with iron ore (iron oxide) and\
  \ forms pig iron. The solid content (coal and iron) moves to the bottom of the furnace\
  \ to the hottest zone (melting zone) where the iron is melted and removed from the\
  \ furnace in liquid state. Slag is formed at the bottom of the furnace (it`s a mixture\
  \ of different oxides). Waste gases (containing excess carbon monoxide) leave the\
  \ furnace at the top and are incinerated which produces electricity (energy credit\
  \ is modelled). System boundary: Type of the EPD: cradle-to-gate. Modules A1-A3\
  \ of the structural steel production include the following: The provision of resources,\
  \ additives, and energy Transport of resources and additives to the production site\
  \ Production processes on-site including energy, production of additives, disposal\
  \ of production residues, and consideration of related emissions Granulation process\
  \ of slag leaving the blast furnace. An economical allocation was applied for the\
  \ GBFS taking into account 5 years of market values of Hot Rolled Coil and GBFS.\
  \ Other materials and chemicals used were modelled using the allocation rule most\
  \ suitable for the respective product. \nTechnical data: \nGBFS minimum technical\
  \ specifications have to answer the criteria listed in EN 197-1: \n\nCaO+SiO2+MgO\
  \ > 66 %\n(CaO+MgO)/SiO2 > 1\n Glass ratio > 66 % \nDeclared unit: \nThe declaration\
  \ refers to the functional unit of 1 metric ton of Granulated Blast Furnace Slag\
  \ as specified in Part B requirements on the EPD for cement.\n\nThe Life Cycle Assessment\
  \ is based on data collected from the following ArcelorMittal plants:\n\nAviles-Gijon\
  \ (Spain)\nBremen (Germany)\nDabrowa (Poland)\nDunkirk (France)\nEisenh\xFCttenstadt\
  \ (Germany)\nFos-sur-Mer (France)\nGent (Belgium) The final results reflect the\
  \ weighted average per production volume of European ArcelorMittal blast furnace\
  \ plants. When comparing the LCA results average against specific LCA results from\
  \ the sites included in this study, variance is within the expected range. For GWP,\
  \ the variance was within an 8 % range.\n\nThe background data are taken from GaBi\
  \ ts Documentation."
