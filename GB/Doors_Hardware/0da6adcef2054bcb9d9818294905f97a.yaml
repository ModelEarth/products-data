  \ are complete and representative of North America in terms of the geographic and\
  \ technological coverage and are a recent vintage (i.e. less than ten years old).\
  \ The data used for primary data are based on direct information sources of the\
  \ manufacturer. Secondary data sets were used for raw materials extraction and processing,\
  \ end of life, transportation, and energy production flows. Wherever secondary data\
  \ is used, the study adopts critically reviewed data for consistency, precision,\
  \ and reproducibility to limit uncertainty. Period Under Review The period under\
  \ review is the 2015 calendar year. Environment 6 of 10 Environmental Product Declaration\
  \ According Yale\xAE 8800 Series Mortise Lock to Door and door hardware ISO 14025\
  \ Allocation Plant personnel from Berlin completed allocation based on product type.\
  \ The number of machine steps required in the manufacturing process for each product\
  \ type was analyzed to capture the variable manufacturing intensity across different\
  \ product types. As such, unit allocation was completed with additional weighting\
  \ given to more complex products. Comparability A comparison or an evaluation of\
  \ EPD data is only possible if all data sets to be compared were created according\
  \ to EN 15804 and the building context, respectively the product-specific characteristics\
  \ of performance, are taken into account. Environmental delarations from different\
  \ programs may not be comparable. Full conformance with the PCR for North American\
  \ Builders Hardware products allows EPD comparability only when all stages of a\
  \ Builders Hardware product's life cycle have been considered. However, variations\
  \ and deviations are possible. LCA: Modeling Scenarios and Additional Technical\

  \ The production life cycle stage (A1-A3) dominates the impacts across all impact\
  \ categories. This is due to the upstream production of metals used in the product,\
  \ along with electricity use in the manufacturing of the product. Potential benefits\
  \ in all impact categories other than ozone depletion are due to the potential avoided\
  \ burden of recycled metals after disposal. Transportation (A2) has a negligble\
  \ impact within the production stage. Distribution (A4) and Installation (A5) both\
  \ have minor impacts compared to the production stage. The figure below shows the\
  \ graphical representation of these impacts across the product's life cycle stages:\
