description: "Woven glass fibre wall covering, manufactured by Vitrulan Textile Glass\
  \ GmbH, is made of glass yarns and used for both, functional and decorative purposes.\
  \ It is generally distinguished from wall paperings based on a paper substrate by\
  \ a high-quality special glass woven fabric which is used as the substrate material.\
  \ The glass fibre wall covering is a structured, patterned or practically smooth\
  \ fabric comprising glass yarns arranged vertically and horizontally. Generally,\
  \ it is glued on walls and ceilings and painted afterwards. It may include white\
  \ pigments to reduce processing time on the construction site. It is particularly\
  \ easy to handle: it does not shrink or stretch, is easy to cut and produces perfect\
  \ seams. It reinforces walls, covers cracks, and prevents new cracks from forming.\
  \ During application, the wall or ceiling is pasted and then the strip of wall covering\
  \ is hung on the prepared paste bed, or, alternatively, the wall covering comes\
  \ with a water-activatable adhesive which is already applied to the wall coverings\
  \ backing \u2013 this adhesive can be easily activated by water using the Aqua-Quick\
  \ device specially developed for this purpose. Vitrulans Aqua Technology facilitates\
  \ work and reduces processing times for the user. Since woven glass fibre wall coverings\
  \ are designed to reinforce walls and ceilings, they are bonded to the buildings\
  \ structure. This means that they are disposed of as construction waste. Waste arising\
  \ from installation can generally be disposed of as household waste since glass\
  \ fibre wall coverings are not classed as special waste. Our woven glass fibre wall\
  \ covering is OEKO-TEX-certified and completely non-hazardous to health. Sustainable\
  \ interior design and premium product quality are hallmarks of all our textile glass\
  \ fibre wall coverings."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis specific EPD document refers to woven\
  \ glass fibre wall covering produced by Vitrulan Textile Glass GmbH. The production\
  \ data was recorded in 2021. The production plant is located in Marktschorgast,\
  \ Germany. \nSystem boundary: \nType of EPD according to EN 15804: \"cradle to gate\
  \ with options, modules C1\u2013C4, and module D\". The following modules are declared:\
  \ A1\u2013A3, C, D and additional modules: A4 + A5.\n\nThe following life cycle\
  \ stages are considered:\n\nProduction - Modules A1-A3\nThe product stage includes:\n\
  Raw material supply (A1): glass yarns and coating based on starch besides polymeric\
  \ materials and inorganic additives. \n\nTransport to the manufacturer (A2)\nManufacturing\
  \ (A3), including provision of all materials, products and energy, as well as waste\
  \ processing up to the end-of-waste state.\nConstruction Stage - Modules A4- A5\n\
  The construction process stage includes:\n\nTransport to the construction site (A4)\n\
  Treatment of packaging material (A5) credits for potential avoided burdens due to\
  \ energy substitution of electricity and thermal energy generation are declared\
  \ in module D. Installation losses are also included in this module.\n\nEnd-of-Life\
  \ Stage - Modules C1-C4\n\nMechanical dismantling is considered (C1)\n\nTransport\
  \ to EoL (C2)\n\nDisposal (C4) - landfill of the glass fibre wall covering\n\nBenefits\
  \ and Loads beyond product system boundary \nNo credits were accounted from the\
  \ EoL scenario(C4) in module D. The credits in D are solely accounting for the avoided\
  \ burdens calculated by the inversion of electricity grid mix and thermal energy\
  \ from natural gas during packaging treatment (A5).\n\n# Technology Description\
  \ And Included Processes\n\nWoven glass fibre wall covering, manufactured by Vitrulan\
  \ Textile Glass GmbH, contains ca. 0.116 kg/m2 glass yarns and ca. 0.029 kg/m2 coating\
  \ based on starch, polymeric materials and inorganic additives. It is produced in\
  \ three main phases: Glass fibre manufacture: The basic components of a glass batch\
  \ are silica sand, limestone, kaolin, and boric acid. These components are fused\
  \ at approx. 1250\u02DAC. The molten glass flows by gravity through the nozzles\
  \ of a bushing plate made of platinum alloy to form filaments. A surface coating\
  \ called a 'size' is applied to the individual filaments before they are gathered\
  \ into a strand. The size largely determines the processing characteristics of the\
  \ glass fibre material. The glass filaments are directed across a picking roll which\
  \ combines the individual filaments as glass fibre strands before winding them on\
  \ a bobbin. These spools are then subjected to a drying process. The textile glass\
  \ yarns are partially textured to give the fabric's structure more volume. Warp\
  \ beam manufacture and weaving fabrics: It involves attaching the textile glass\
  \ yarns to fibre creels and combining as warp beams. In the weaving area, gripper\
  \ needle and air-jet weaving looms generate textile glass fabric from the weft and\
  \ warp materials. This is referred to as manufacturing fabric from glass yarns which\
  \ are manufactured on weaving looms by means of crossing two thread systems. Coating\
  \ and dispatch: In the coating area, these textile glass fabrics are attributed\
  \ a finishing treatment that completely coats the fabrics. The finish is normally\
  \ applied using a special technique in which both sides of the unprocessed fabrics\
  \ are impregnated and then dried. The finish determines essential product characteristics\
  \ such as stability, warp thread bonding, cutting capability, flexibility, feel,\
  \ and surface roughness. Basically, the finish primes the surface optimally for\
  \ subsequent application and painting. The finish for our pre-pigmented glass fabrics\
  \ contains high quality white pigments \u2013 this makes painting works on the construction\
  \ site highly economically and significantly reduces labor and material costs. In\
  \ the packing area, the dried and coated fabrics are wound and shortened in line\
  \ with customer specifications. In the packaging area, the picked rolls are packaged\
  \ individually before being sent for dispatch. \nTechnical data: \nMain characteristics\
  \ of our woven glass fibre wall covering are:\nSuperb reaction to fire: B-s1, d0\
  \ according to DIN EN 13501-1\nWall reinforcing and crack bridging\nImpact and perforation\
  \ resistant\nAbrasion and scrub resistant (depending on the coating)\nResistant\
  \ to disinfectants and cleaning agents (depending on the coating)\nNon-toxic and\
  \ food-safe: OEKO-TEX-certified\nWater vapour permeable\nSuitable for allergy sufferers\n\
  In addition to the many technical benefits, our woven glass fibre wall coverings\
  \ provide almost limitless scope for creativity when it comes to interior design\
  \ \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared unit refers to 1 m2 of woven glass fibre wall\
  \ covering with an area weight of 0.145 kg/m."
