description: SteelMaster 1200WF is a one component waterborne acrylic thin film intumescent
  coating. Independently approved for fire protection of structural steel exposed
  to cellulosic fire. It can be used as mid coat or finish coat in atmospheric environments.
  This product is suitable on approved primers on carbon steel substrates. The declared
  product is specially designed as a reactive fire protection system for steel constructions.
  It is designed to protect for up to 180 minutes on a wide range of I section beams,
  columns and hollows. The product is fire tested and approved to BS 476 part 20/21
  and EN13381-8. This product is suitable for structural steel exposed to internal
  environments. For a detailed coating specification please contact your local Jotun
  representative. For information on Green Building Standard credits, see "Additional
  Information" on page 4. The material composition of the declared product is given
  below

  \ is used as basis for the raw material composition. Specific data for the product\
  \ composition and raw material amounts has been provided by the manufacturer and\
  \ represents the production of the declared product. Production site data was collected\
  \ in 2015. Representative data from ecoinvent v3.2 was used for other processes.\
  \ The data quality for the material input in A1 is presented in tabular form. Allocation:\
  \ The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming\
  \ energy, water and waste production in-house is primarily allocated equally among\
  \ all products through mass allocation. Specific allocation was performed for certain\
  \ waste flows according to information provided by the site manager. VOC emissions\
  \ have been allocated entirely to the production of solvent based paints. Effects\
  \ of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in\
  \ which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material\
  \ is allocated to this analysis. Cut-off criteria: All major raw materials and essential\
  \ energy is included. The production process for raw materials and energy flows\
  \ with very small amounts (less than 0.1 % dry matter) are not included. In total,\
  \ more than 99% of the material input is included. These cut-off criteria do not\
  \ apply for non-energy related emissions (such as wastes, hazardous materials and\
  \ substances).\n\n## Source Data Notes\nISO 14025:2010 Environmental labels and\
