  \ which can be plain or perforated to meet acoustic requirements. Acoustic insert,\
  \ made from various combinations and thicknesses of acoustic facings, insulation\
  \ layers bonded together with adhesive. A tile-only system, System 320 consist of\
  \ powder coated steel tile. The system has no grid work, reducing costs and allowing\
  \ for quick and simple installations. Standard system 320 tiles modules are manufactured\
  \ in the following sizes 1200 x 300mm, 1200 x 600mm, 1500 x 300mm, 1500 x 600mm,\
  \ 1800 x 300mm, 1800x 600mm, 3000 x 300mm & 3000 x 600mm. Depending on the tiles\
  \ size the steel thickness/gauge will vary between 0.65 to 1.5mm for standard size\
  \ tiles. Bespoke sizes can be manufactured to suit client/project requirements.\
  \ The system has no grid work, reducing costs and allowing for quick and simple\
  \ installations. The system is suspended from edge trims or other suitable features\
  \ such as lights or grilles. Intended for corridor and plasterboard surround applications,\
  \ System 320 is ideal for residential and commercial sectors with targeted acoustic\
  \ demands. Tiles can be of any size to suit most building modules and trimmed for\
  \ improved aesthetics across undulating walls. EPD Number: 214 Date of Issue:13\

  \ 3.5%, Aluminium foil facing, 1.5%, Acoustic insulation core, 2%, Tissue facing,\
  \ 1%, Adhesive, 0.2%\n\n## Source Data Notes\nThe supporting LCA study was carried\
  \ out using BRE LINA v2.0.8 using manufacturer specific data provided by SAS International\
  \ for the production period of the 12 months of 2017. Raw material quantities have\
  \ been taken from recorded production/manufacture data and product geometry from\
  \ the Syteline internal production system, for all variations of the SAS 320 steel\
  \ tile with acoustic inserts made in the 12 month period. EPD Number: 214 Date of\
  \ Issue:13 November 2018 Expiry Date 10 November 2023 BF1805-C Rev 0.0 Page 5 of\
  \ 9 \xA9 BRE Global Ltd, 2017 SAS International manufacture other products in addition\
  \ to the System 320 so some allocation of primary data has been carried out. Since\
  \ the manufacturing steps responsible for slitting, perforating and drying the coated\
  \ metal are the most energy intensive processes of the site, it is assumed that\
  \ the gas and electricity consumption is the same for every m2 of metal product\
  \ produced. This same allocation was applied to total site water usage. Production\
  \ waste has been allocated to individual products by applying a percentage wastage\
  \ rate (based on historical values and used for stock management) to each quantity\
  \ of raw material. All packaging and non- production waste (waste packaging) has\
  \ also been allocated using this methodology with applied percentage based on planned/estimated\
  \ packaging and waste requirements for each product/system/components. Secondary\
  \ data has been drawn from the BRE LINA database v2.0.32 and the background LCI\
  \ datasets are based on ecoinvent v3.2. Upstream extraction and/or processing of\
  \ inputs are included within the use of the background datasets within LINA. Emissions\
  \ from fuels used are included within the relevant datasets."
