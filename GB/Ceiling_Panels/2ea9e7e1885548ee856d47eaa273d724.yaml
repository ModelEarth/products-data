lca_discussion: '## Product Component Notes

  Steel 95.5% Polyester Powder Coating 4.5%


  ## Source Data Notes

  The supporting LCA study was carried out using BRE LINA v2.0.8 using manufacturer
  specific data provided by SAS International for the production period of the 12
  months of 2017 Raw material quantities have been taken from recorded production/manufacture
  data and product geometry from the Syteline internal production system, for all
  variations of the SAS 510 steel baffle only systems made in the 12 month period.
  SAS International manufacture other products in addition to the System 510 so some
  allocation of primary data has been carried out. Since the manufacturing steps responsible
  for slitting, perforating and drying the coated metal are the most energy intensive
  processes of the site, it is assumed that the gas and electricity consumption is
  the same for every m2 of metal product produced. This same allocation was applied
  to total site water usage. Production waste has been allocated to individual products
  by applying a percentage wastage rate (based on historical values and used for stock
  management) to each quantity of raw material. All packaging and non- production
  waste (waste packaging) has also been allocated using this methodology with applied
  percentage based on planned/estimated packaging and waste requirements for each
  product/system/components. Secondary data has been drawn from the BRE LINA database
  v2.0.29 and the background LCI datasets are based on ecoinvent v3.2. Upstream extraction
  and/or processing of inputs are included within the use of the background datasets
  within LINA. Emissions from fuels used are included within the relevant datasets.'
