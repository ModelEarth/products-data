  \ covering a production period of 1 year (1/01/16 - 31/12/16) obtained from Pasquill\
  \ production processes in the ten production sites was used. At some of the production\
  \ sites, Pasquill manufacture other finished products in addition to the roof trusses.\
  \ Where this has been the case, calculations were performed to allocate total site\
  \ energy use, water, and waste to the roof truss products. Allocation procedures\
  \ were by physical allocation and are according to EN 15804 and are based on the\
  \ ISO14044 guidance. SimaPro v8 software was used to carry out the LCA modelling,\
  \ with background LCI datasets taken from the ecoinvent database v3.2. All ecoinvent\
  \ datasets are complete within the context used and conform to the system boundary\
  \ and the criteria for the exclusion of inputs and outputs according to the requirements\
  \ specified in EN15804. The trusses produced at the Pasquill sites include both\
  \ treated and untreated wood. This EPD covers both truss types and the individual\
  \ site data have been combined on a mass weighted average based on production volume."
