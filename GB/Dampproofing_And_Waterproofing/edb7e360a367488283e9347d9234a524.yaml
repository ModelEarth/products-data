  ## Source Data Notes

  The primary data provided by Sika derive from the plant at Preston, UK for 2016,
  with total site mass-weighted allocation to product, as the process is similar for
  all membranes produced there. The EMEA extrapolation is based on UK data. The transport
  distances were adapted to EMEA region, typical and average transport distances at
  Sika in EMEA region were used for raw materials transport, as well as for transport
  to building site and transport to waste final disposal and processing. Background
  LCI datasets are taken from the databases of GaBi software Version 7.3.3 with Database
  2017 and ecoinvent Version 3.3. All datasets are less than 6 years old. Benefits
  from incineration and landfilling of product losses and for the disposal of packaging
  are credited in Module D; this also applies to the reuse of wooden pallets.'
