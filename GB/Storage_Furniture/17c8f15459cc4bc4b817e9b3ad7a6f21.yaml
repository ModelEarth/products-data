description: "The declared products of HUS4-MAX and KHC adhesive capsules are two-component\
  \ construction adhesives used in combination with mechanical screw anchors in Hiltis\
  \ HUS4-MAX and Kwik-X Dual Anchor Action systems. Component A comprises a resin\
  \ based on methacrylate as well as mineral filler. Component B comprises peroxide\
  \ hardener, water and mineral filler.\nDuring the setting of a mechanical screw\
  \ anchor in a borehole containing the adhesive capsule, the capsule foil is pierced\
  \ to allow mixing of the two individual components which subsequently enables the\
  \ A component to polymerase via radicals released by the B component in a so-called\
  \ chain reaction. As a result a homogeneously cured mortar with excellent proven\
  \ mechanical properties, durability and bond strength arises over a very short curing\
  \ time.\nComposite foils are used for the HUS4-MAX and the KHC capsules. This kind\
  \ of packaging serves the following purposes: waste volume reduction, easy storage\
  \ and transport, less packaging material.\nThe reaction resins used in Hilti adhesive\
  \ capsules contain no styrene, are practically odourless and have a considerably\
  \ higher flash point, i.e. higher than 100\xB0 C."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis document refers to the adhesive capsules\
  \ HUS4-MAX and KHC with their packaging. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment,\
  \ specific data were collected from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI\
  \ AG. For the compilation of the life\ncycle assessment, specific data were collected\
  \ from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI AG. Data from the years 2018\
  \ to 2021 are used, which correspond to the annual average. \nSystem boundary: \n\
  Type of EPD:\ncradle to gate with options.The following information modules are\
  \ defined as system boundaries in this study:\n\nProduction stage (A1- A3):\n\n\u2022\
  \ A1, raw material extraction,\n\n\u2022 A2, transport to manufacturer,\n\n\u2022\
  \ A3, manufacture.\n\nEnd of life\n(C1- C4):\n\n\u2022 C1, dismantling/demolition,\n\
  \n\u2022 C2, transportation,\n\n\u2022 C3, waste treatment,\n\n\u2022 C4, elimination.\n\
  \nReuse, recovery\nand recycling potential (D)\n\nIn order to precisely record the\
  \ indicators and environmental impacts of the declared unit, a total of 8 information\
  \ modules are considered. The information modules A1 to A3 describe the provision\
  \ of materials, the transport to the production site and the production processes\
  \ of the product itself.\n\nThe primary products are sourced from the European Union\
  \ and Asia .Transport is by truck and ship. The following flow charts illustrate\
  \ the underlying production process.\n\nIllustration 1: Information module A1 to\
  \ A3 of\nproduct (part 1)\n\n\nIllustration 2:\nInformation module A1 to A3 of product\
  \ (part 2)\n\n\nIllustration 3:\nInformation module A1 to A3 of packaging\n\nIn\
  \ the information modules C1 to C4, the deconstruction or demolition from the building,\
  \ the transport to waste disposal, the waste treatment and disposal of the product\
  \ are recorded. Furthermore, reuse, recovery and recycling potentials are shown\
  \ in information module D.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\n\
  All raw materials are sourced in Europe or Asia. The transport is exclusively by\
  \ truck for the European raw materials, and by truck and by ship for the others.\
  \ Chemical mortars are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and\
  \ a hardener. One of the base components of the binder is the reactive resin which\
  \ in the case of HUS4-MAx and KHC is produced in Kaufering. The resin production\
  \ process is a chemical reaction of the corresponding educts to a basic resin with\
  \ subsequent mixing of the basic resin with different reactive diluents to a reactive\
  \ resin. This process is controlled and monitored by process control technology.\
  \ The production of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling\
  \ process of the respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent\
  \ union to a two-component system (packaging). Here as well process control technology\
  \ is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to the specification.\
  \ In the next step both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line\
  \ in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally\
  \ the single components are combined in one packaging unit. The two-pack foil bags\
  \ are packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped. The manufacturing plant\
  \ of HUS4-MAX and KHC, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft f\xFCr Befestigungstechnik,\
  \ Hiltistr. 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The\
  \ guideline defines international standards for quality and process management.\
  \ \nDeclared unit: \nThe notified product is an injection mortar of HILTI AG with\
  \ the designation HUS4-MAX 12 as a representative product from the HUS4-MAX and\
  \ KHC portfolio, as only the packaging proportions change per 1 kilogram of injection\
  \ mortar. The declared unit refers to 1 kg of reaction resin product in the mixing\
  \ ratio of the two components required for processing. The packaging, related to\
  \ 1 kg injection mortar, is additionally included in the calculation with 0.355\
  \ kg. The following table shows the data of the declared unit."
