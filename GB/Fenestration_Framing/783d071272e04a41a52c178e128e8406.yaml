lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis declaration applies to 1 metric ton\
  \ of XCarb\xAE recycled and renewably produced organic coated steel coil (Granite\xAE\
  \ and Estetic\xAE). \n\n\nThe Life Cycle Assessment is based on the LCA model and\
  \ data for ArcelorMittal XCarb\xAE recycled and renewably produced hot rolled coils,\
  \ coupled with downstream processes at ArcelorMittal plants, representing 95 % of\
  \ the production XCarb\xAE recycled and renewably produced organic coated steel\
  \ (Granite\xAE and Estetic\xAE). \nSystem boundary: \nType of EPD: cradle to gate\
  \ with modules C1\u2013C4 and module D (A1-A3, C and D)\n\nModules A1-A3 of the\
  \ steel and coating production include:\n\nThe provision of resources, additives,\
  \ and energy\nTransport of resources and additives to the production site\nTransport\
  \ of intermediate products within ArcelorMittal sites\nProduction processes on site\
  \ including energy, production of additives, disposal of production residues, and\
  \ consideration of related emissions.\nRecycling of production/manufacturing scrap.\
  \ Steel scrap is assumed to reach the end-of-waste status once is shredded and sorted,\
  \ thus becoming input to the product system in the inventory.Module C1 assumes a\
  \ generic multi-story building demolition scenario. \n\nModule C2 includes impacts\
  \ of assumed distances of 100 km from the demolition site of a scrap processing\
  \ plant and 200 km from this plant to the disposal. In both cases, empty returns\
  \ of transport were assumed.\n\nModule C3 takes into account the sorting and shredding\
  \ of after-use steel to allow its orientation towards the recycling solutions. This\
  \ process will also produce losses due to efficiency that will be oriented towards\
  \ landfill sites. A conservative value of 2 % landfill is then considered in C4.\n\
  \nModule C4 takes into account the waste disposal including physical pre-treatment\
  \ and management of the disposal site. Steel is an inert material which does not\
  \ require any specific treatment on the disposal site.\n\nModule D refers to the\
  \ end of life of structural steel, including reuse and recycling.\n\n# Technology\
  \ Description And Included Processes\n\nThis Environmental Product Declaration refers\
  \ to organic coated steel coil in the XCarb\xAE renewably and recycled produced\
  \ Granite\xAE and Estetic\xAE product range. This product comes from a production\
  \ process flow which only uses XCarb\xAE Recycled and Renewably Produced Hot Rolled\
  \ Coil. The Granite\xAE and Estetic\xAE range combines metallic coated steel substrates\
  \ with a protective organic coating system to create robust products with longer\
  \ life and high resistance. These two types of prepainted products are available\
  \ in a wide range of steel grades aimed for architectural buildings for outdoor\
  \ use (roofing , cladding) and indoor use (domestic appliance, industry, building\
  \ parts) processed by drawing, roll forming, flanging or spinning. Granite\xAE &\
  \ Estetic\xAE prepainted steels are constituted of a metallic coating with coating\
  \ masses from 18 to 350 g/m\xB2 and an organic coating with thicknesses as follows:\
  \ Top side 25 \u03BCm to 70 \u03BCm for Granite\xAE and 15 \u03BCm to 55 \u03BC\
  m for Estetic\xAE, Back side 5 \u03BCm to 70 \u03BCm for Granite\xAE and 5 \u03BC\
  m to 25 \u03BCm for Estetic\xAE. The production is by the secondary route, in which\
  \ different steel scraps are melted in an electric arc furnace to obtain liquid\
  \ steel. This steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys\
  \ and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted\
  \ at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products as billet or blooms. These\
  \ products are then rolled to the desired size. The rib profile is rolled onto the\
  \ bar in the last stand of the rolling process. The produced liquid steel is then\
  \ refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the\
  \ required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster\
  \ to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. The following\
  \ operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling\
  \ mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization\
  \ temperature. The qualities obtained in this process are e.g. strength and surface\
  \ quality. During the rolling process the material passes through the furnace and\
  \ the rolling line. In the furnace the metal is preheated by natural gas. There\
  \ is no need for an additional warming, if the hot slabs are directly charged into\
  \ the rolling mill. The forming is done in various rolling frames until the final\
  \ shape is obtained. The steel scrap in this process are directly recycled. In the\
  \ cold rolling mill the material is reshaped below the recrystallization temperature.\
  \ Thereby a enhanced surface quality, an improved dimensional accuracy as well as\
  \ a higher strength are achieved. The different process steps are: pickling, the\
  \ rolling line and the heat treatment. he rolled coil can be then metallic coated\
  \ with various mixtures of metal coating such as Zn, Al, Mg and Si. After metallic\
  \ coated, the coil is further organic coated. \nTechnical data: \nThe thickness\
  \ of coatings (i.e. metallic layer and organic coating) varies according to the\
  \ intended end use of the products. Granite\xAE is suitable for outdoor applications\
  \ whereas Estetic\xAE is preferred for indoor applications. Granite\xAE and Estetic\xAE\
  \ products can be processed by bending, profiling, cold roll forming and deep drawing\
  \ without damaging the top surface. They can be joined using techniques such as\
  \ clinching, riveting and adhesive bonding. These products are in compliance with\
  \ EN 10169 standard. \n\nDetailed steel and coating properties and chemical compositions\
  \ for the different products in the Granite\xAE and Estetic\xAE range are available\
  \ at:\n\nhttps://industry.arcelormittal.com/catalogue/F30/EN,\nhttps://industry.arcelormittal.com/catalogue/F40/EN\
  \ and\nhttps://industry.arcelormittal.com/catalogue/F20/EN. \nDeclared unit: \n\
  The declaration refers to the functional unit of 1 metric ton of double-sided XCarb\xAE\
  \ recycled and renewably produced organic coated steel from the Granite\xAE and\
  \ Estetic\xAE range, packed and ready to be transported from ArcelorMittal to its\
  \ clients as specified in Part B requirements of the EPD.\n\nThe results are calculated\
  \ based on a 0.47 mm steel thickness with 225 g/m\xB2 metallic coating and 40 \u03BC\
  m organic coating thickness (total on both sides). Prior to the coating steps, the\
  \ steel substrate has been cold rolled from an XCarb\xAE recycled and renewably\
  \ produced hot rolled coil."
