lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nDeclared unit 1 m3 Conversion factor\
  \ to 1 kg 0.0015 - Density 660 kg/m\xB3 3.2 System boundary The EPD is therefore\
  \ from the \"cradle to plant gate, with options\". The Life Cycle Assessment of\
  \ the products under review comprises the \"Product stage\" and \"Benefits and loads\
  \ beyond the product system boundaries\". The systems therefore include the following\
  \ stages in accordance with /EN 15804/: Product stage (Modules A1-A3): \xB7 A1 Raw\
  \ material provision and processing and processing processes for secondary materials\
  \ serving as input \xB7 A2 Transport to the manufacturer \xB7 A3 Production The\
  \ product stages, A4-A5, B1-B7 and C1-C4 were not taken into consideration in this\
  \ study. Once the product has reached End-of-Waste status as waste wood chips, it\
  \ is assumed that the product is routed to biomass incineration producing thermal\
  \ energy and electricity. The ensuing impacts and credits are declared in Module\
  \ D. The optional Modules C1 to C4 were not integrated in the study. Integration\
  \ of these modules would include calculation of the impacts for C3 by sorting and\
  \ chipping wood for thermal utilisation. The anticipated impact of these modules\
  \ compared to A1-A3 / D can be estimated as very low and is not therefore taken\
  \ into consideration. 3.3 Estimates and assumptions The End-of-Life system boundary\
  \ between waste disposal and Module D is applied where outputs such as secondary\
  \ materials or fuels reach their End-of- Waste status (EN 15804, section 6.4.3).\
  \ It is assumed that waste wood reaches End-of-Waste status after sorting and processing.\
  \ In order to calculate the net flows for Module \"D\", the waste wood quantities\
  \ for Egger raw chipboard are applied which are integrated in the system and thermally\
  \ utilised in Modules A1-A3. In order to calculate the net flows, the waste wood\
  \ quantity used for producing thermal energy and electricity was added to the waste\
  \ wood volume contained in leftover wood incurred during production. In order to\
  \ obtain the share of waste wood contained in wood leftovers, the total volume of\
  \ input materials was divided by the waste wood input volume used in production.\
  \ This can be explained by the fact that production leftovers represent a mixture\
  \ of all input materials. This gives rise to a waste wood share of around 33% in\
  \ production leftovers. The ensuing total was deducted from the overall product\
  \ mass. The product mass reduced by the share of waste wood burned in production\
  \ is then incinerated at the End of Life. 3.4 Cut-off criteria All operating data\
  \ was taken into consideration. Accordingly, material flows with a share of less\
  \ than 1% were also balanced. It can therefore be assumed that the total processes\
  \ ignored do not exceed 5% of the impact categories and the cut-off criteria are\
  \ complied with in accordance with /EN 15804/. 3.5 Background data All relevant\
  \ background data sets were taken from the /GaBi 6/ (GABI 6 2013) software data\
  \ base and are not older than 10 years. The data used was obtained under consistent\
  \ time- and method-based marginal conditions. 3.6 Data quality Data on the products\
  \ reviewed was captured directly at the production facility for fiscal 2013 on the\
  \ basis of a questionnaire developed by the consulting firm PE International. The\
  \ input and output data was made available by Egger and examined for plausibility\
  \ with 6 Environmental Product Declaration Fritz EGGER GmbH & Co. OG - EUROSPAN\xAE\
  \ Raw Chipboard the result that good data representativity can be assumed. 3.7 Period\
  \ under review All primary data from the operational data survey by Egger for 2010\
  \ was taken into consideration, i.e. all of the output materials used for the formulation,\
  \ energy requirements and all direct production waste were taken into consideration\
  \ in the analysis. The actual transport distances and means of transport (L: truck,\
  \ S: articulated truck, Z: rail) were applied for all inputs and outputs. 3.8 Allocation\
  \ Allocation of energy credits for electricity and thermal energy produced in the\
  \ biomass power plant at the En"
