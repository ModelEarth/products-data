description: "The declared product of HIT-HY 170 is a\ntwo component system. The resin\
  \ component (component A) comprises a resin based\non methacrylate as well as mineral\
  \ and cementitious fillers. The\ncuring agent component (component B) comprises\
  \ peroxide hardener, water and\nmineral fillers. Mixing the two components A and\
  \ B in the static mixer\ninitiates the curing (hardening) reaction of both binder\
  \ systems. During the\ncuring phase, a very strong bond is formed between the organic\
  \ and inorganic\nbinder matrix. The hybrid system formed during cement and resin\
  \ curing results\nin a crosslinked duromer with desired design properties (high\
  \ bond strengths\nwithin a short curing time) and particular durability.\nComposite\
  \ foils are used for the two component foil pack of HIT-HY170. This\nkind of packaging\
  \ serves the following purposes: waste volume reduction, easy\nstorage and transport,\
  \ and less packaging material. Through legislation and\nincreased public awareness\
  \ users have increasingly become discerned towards the\nuse of styrene and other\
  \ highly volatile components with their resulting\nunpleasant odour and low flash\
  \ point (flammability). The reaction resins\nused in all Hilti hybrid adhesives\
  \ contain no styrene, are practically odourless\nand have a considerably higher\
  \ flash point, i.e. higher than 100\xB0C in\ncomparison to 34\xB0 C for styrene\
  \ based products. HIT-HY170 is a\npremium performance injectable hybrid mortar with\
  \ approvals for rebar\nconnections and heavy-duty anchoring."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis\ndocument refers to the injectable\
  \ mortar HIT-HY 170 with its packaging. For\nthe compilation of the life cycle assessment,\
  \ specific data were collected from\nthe factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI\
  \ AG. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment, specific data were collected\
  \ from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI AG. Data from the years 2018\
  \ to 2021 are used, which correspond to the annual average. \nSystem boundary: \n\
  Type of EPD:\ncradle to gate with options.The following information modules are\

  \ A1 to\nA3 describe the provision of materials, the transport to the production\
  \ site\nand the production processes of the product itself.\n\n\n\nThe main products\
  \ are sourced from the European Union and Asia. Transport is by truck and ship.\

  \ module A1 to A3 of packaging\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\
  \nMost raw materials are sourced in Europe. The transport is exclusively by truck\
  \ for the European raw materials, and by truck and by ship for the others. Chemical\
  \ mortars are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and a hardener.\
  \ One of the base components of the binder is the reactive resin which in the case\
  \ of HIT-HY 170 is produced in Kaufering. The resin production process is a chemical\
  \ reaction of the corresponding educts to a basic resin with subsequent mixing of\
  \ the basic resin with different reactive diluents to a reactive resin. This process\
  \ is controlled and monitored by process control technology. The production of chemical\
  \ mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling process of the respective single\
  \ components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent union to a two-component\
  \ system (packaging). Here as well process control technology is used to weigh and\
  \ mix solid and liquid compounds according to the specification. In the next step\
  \ both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line in which each\
  \ of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally the single\
  \ components are combined in one packaging unit. The two-pack foil bags are packed\
  \ into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped. The manufacturing plant of HIT-HY\
  \ 170, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft f\xFCr Befestigungstechnik, Hiltistr. 6,\
  \ 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The guideline defines\
  \ international standards for quality and process management. \nDeclared unit: \n\
  The product declared here is an injection mortar from HILTI AG with the designation\
  \ HIT-HY 170. The declared unit refers to 1 kg reaction resin product in the mixing\
  \ ratio of the two components required for processing. The packaging, based on 1\
  \ kg of reaction resin product, is also calculated at 0.149 kg. The table below\
  \ shows the data of the declared unit."
