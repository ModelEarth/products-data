description: "/Product definition The declared product of HIT-RE 500 V4 is a two-\
  \ component system. The resin component (component A) comprises a resin based on\
  \ epoxides as well as mineral fillers. The curing agent component (component B)\
  \ comprises of amine hardener, mineral and cement-like fillers. Mixing the two components\
  \ A and B in the static mixer initiates the curing (hardening) reaction of both\
  \ binder systems. During the curing phase, a very strong bond 2 is formed between\
  \ the organic and inorganic binder matrix. The system formed during curing results\
  \ in a cross-linked duromer with desired design properties (high bond strengths\
  \ within defined curing time) and particular long-term stability. Composite foils\
  \ are used for the two-component foil pack of HIT-RE 500 V4. This kind of packaging\
  \ serves the following purposes: waste volume reduction, easy storage and transport,\
  \ less packaging material. Through legislation and increased public awareness users\
  \ have increasingly become discerned towards the Environmental Product Declaration\
  \ Hilti AG - HIT-RE 500 V4 use of highly volatile components with their resulting\
  \ unpleasant odour and low flash point (flammability). The reaction resins used\
  \ in all Hilti adhesives are practically odourless and have a considerably higher\
  \ flash point, i.e. higher than 100 \xB0C in comparison to 34 \xB0C for styrene-based\
  \ products. HIT-RE 500 V4 is the high-performance injectable hybrid mortar with\
  \ approvals for rebar connections and heavy duty anchoring. For the placing of the\
  \ product on the market in the European Union European Free Trade Association EU/EFTA)\
  \ (with the exception of Switzerland) the Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.\
  \ The product needs a declaration of performance taking into consideration the following\
  \ European Technical Approvals ETA 20/0793 ETA 20/0539 ETA 20/0834 ETA 20/0540 ETA-20/0541\
  \ and the CE-marking. For the application and use the respective national provisions\
  \ apply."

lca_discussion: "# Use Advice\n\nScope: \nThis document refers to the injectable mortar\
  \ HIT-RE 500 V4 with its packaging. For the compilation of the life cycle assessment,\
  \ specific data were collected from the factory in Kaufering, Germany, of the HILTI\
  \ AG. Data from the year 2020 are used, which correspond to the annual average.\n\
  \n\nThe owner of the declaration shall be liable for the underlying information\
  \ and evidence; the IBU shall not be liable with respect to manufacturer information,\
  \ life cycle assessment data and evidences. The EPD was created according to the\
  \ specifications of EN 15804+A2. In the following, the standard will be simplified\
  \ as EN 15804. \nSystem boundary: \nThe type of the EPD is cradle to grave. The\
  \ following information modules are defined as system boundaries in this study:\
  \ \n\n\nA1 \u2013 Raw material supply:  \n\nProduction and packaging of the raw\
  \ materials to be supplied to the manufacturer. All processes are included from\
  \ cradle to gate. \n\nA2 \u2013 Transport (to manufacturing site):  \n\nTransportation\
  \ of all the raw materials and their packaging between their production site and\
  \ the manufacturing site, for all transport modes (sea, road).  \n\nA3 \u2013 Manufacturing:\
  \  \n\nProduction, supply and use of energy sources at the manufacturing sites (electricity,\
  \ biomass and natural gas). Green electricity  from wind turbines is considered\
  \ for the whole manufacturing process. \n\nProduction and transport of production\
  \ losses, final product packaging and other inputs.  \n\nEnd-of-life of production\
  \ waste (hazardous, non-hazardous and recyclable), production losses and raw material\
  \ packaging,  including waste and losses transportation, processing and disposal.\
  \ \n\nA4 \u2013 Transport (to construction site) \n\nTransportation of packaged\
  \ products from the manufacturing site to the construction site, including potential\
  \ in-betweens (retailer, workshop, etc.). \n\nA5 \u2013 Installation-Construction\
  \ \n\nElectricity consumption for drilling and injecting (in case of injection with\
  \ electrical dispenser). \n\nProduction of the construction losses. \n\nProvision\
  \ and end-of-life of tools and accessories for injectable mortars (manual or electrical\
  \ dispenser with or without battery and with cartridge holder). \n\nEnd-of-life\
  \ of hazardous construction losses and packaging (uncured mortar and soiled packaging)\
  \ and non-hazardous construction losses (cured mortar and unsoiled packaging): including\
  \ waste transportation, processing and disposal. \n\nC1 \u2013 Deconstruction/demolition\
  \ \n\nDiesel for building demolition.  \n\nC2 \u2013 Transport (to waste processing)\
  \ \n\nTransportation to waste processing facility. \n\nC4\u2013 Waste disposal \
  \ \n\nTreatment and disposal of plastic to sanitary landfill. \n\n\nFor the environmental\
  \ impact, the use of green electricity (stage A3) was calculated taking into account\
  \ the residual electricity mix for the remaining electricity. The proportion of\
  \ the electricity demand covered by green electricity in the total electricity demand\
  \ is 100%.\n\n# Technology Description And Included Processes\n\nAll raw materials\
  \ are sourced from Europe. The transport is exclusively by truck. Chemical mortars\
  \ are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and a hardener. The production\
  \ of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling process of the\
  \ respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent union\
  \ to a two-component system (container). Here as well process control technology\
  \ is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to specification.\
  \ In the next step both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line\
  \ in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally\
  \ the single components are united in one container. The two-pack foil bags are\
  \ packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped. The manufacturing plant\
  \ of HIT-RE 500 V4, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft f\xFCr Befestigungstechnik,\
  \ Hiltistr. 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The\
  \ guideline defines international standards for quality and process management.\
  \ The following flowcharts illustrate the underlying production process Illustration:\
  \ Production process of the reaction resin mixture Illustration: Production process\
  \ of the packaging \nDeclared unit: \nThe declared product is a HILTI injection\
  \ mortar HIT-RE 500 V4. The declared unit refers to one kilogram of reaction resin\
  \ product in the required mixing ratio of the two components. The packaging of 0,151\
  \ kg/kg of product is also included in the calculation. The following table shows\
  \ the data of the declared unit."
