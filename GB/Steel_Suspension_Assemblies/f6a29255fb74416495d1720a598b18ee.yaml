description: 'The SAS 600 system consist of powder coated steel tile/raft. Standard
  lengths from 300mm to 3000mm, and width are between 300 mm and 1200mm, however bespoke
  size are available on request. System 600 can be plain or perforated to meet acoustic
  and client requirements. The system offers a variety of applications from the purely
  aesthetic to high performance acoustics with service integration. The rafts and
  modules are available in a range of curved, flat or angled profiles as standard.
  Bespoke designs can be achieved to realise highly aspirational interiors. The flexibility
  of SAS 600 rafts and tile modules makes them ideal for both new build and retrofit
  acoustic solutions. Technical Information Property System components are manufactured
  and tested in accordance with BS EN 31964:2014. Essential Characteristics Performance:

lca_discussion: "## Product Component Notes\nSteel, 96.5%, Polyester Powder Coating,\
  \ 3.5%\n\n## Source Data Notes\nThe supporting LCA study was carried out using BRE\
  \ LINA v2,0.8 using manufacturer specific data provided by SAS International for\
  \ the production period of the 12 months of 2017. Raw material quantities have been\
  \ taken from recorded production/manufacture data and product geometry from the\
  \ Syteline internal production system, for all variations of the SAS 600 steel tile/raft\
  \ only systems made in the 12 month period. SAS International manufacture other\
  \ products in addition to the System 600 so some allocation of primary data has\
  \ been carried out. Since the manufacturing steps responsible for slitting, perforating\
  \ and drying the coated metal are the most energy intensive processes of the site,\
  \ it is assumed that the gas and electricity consumption is the same for every m\
  \ 2 of metal product produced. This same allocation was applied to total site water\
  \ usage. Production waste has been allocated to individual products by applying\
  \ a percentage wastage rate (based on historical values and used for stock management)\
  \ to each quantity of raw material. All packaging and non- L production waste (waste\
  \ packaging) has also been allocated using this methodology with applied percentage\
  \ based on planned/estimated packaging and waste requirements for each product/system/components.\
  \ Secondary data has been drawn from the BRE LINA database v2.0.29 and the background\
  \ LCI datasets are based on ecoinvent v3.2. Upstream extraction and/or processing\
  \ of inputs are included within the use of the background datasets within LINA.\
  \ Emissions from fuels used are included within the relevant datasets. Cut off criteria\
  \ - No inputs or outputs have been excluded and all raw materials, packaging and\
  \ transport, energy, water use and wastes, are included, except for direct emissions\
  \ to air, water and soil, which are not measured. EPD Number: 221 Date of Issue:13\
