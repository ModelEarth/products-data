lca_discussion: "\n\n## Product Component Notes\nSteel, 98%, Polyester Powder Coating,\
  \ 2%\n\n## Source Data Notes\nThe supporting LCA study was carried out using BRE\
  \ LINA v2.0.8 using manufacturer specific data provided by SAS International for\
  \ the production period of the 12 months of 2017. Raw material quantities have been\
  \ taken from recorded production/manufacture data and product geometry from the\
  \ Syteline internal production system, for all variations of the SAS 720 \u2018\
  C\u2019 profile system made in the 12 month period. SAS International manufacture\
  \ other products in addition to the System 720 so some allocation of primary data\
  \ has been carried out. Since the manufacturing steps responsible for slitting,\
  \ perforating and drying the coated metal are the most energy intensive processes\
  \ of the site, it is assumed that the gas and electricity consumption is the same\
  \ for every linear meter (LM) metal product produced. This same allocation was applied\
  \ to total site water usage. Production waste has been allocated to individual products\
  \ by applying a percentage wastage rate (based on historical values and used for\
  \ stock management) to each quantity of raw material. All packaging and non-production\
  \ waste (waste packaging) has also been allocated using this methodology with applied\
  \ percentage based on planned/estimated packaging and waste requirements for each\
  \ product/system/components. Secondary data has been drawn from the BRE LINA database\
  \ v2.0.29 and the background LCI datasets are based on ecoinvent v3.2. Upstream\
  \ extraction and/or processing of inputs are included within the use of the background\
  \ datasets within LINA. Emissions from fuels used are included within the relevant\
  \ datasets."
