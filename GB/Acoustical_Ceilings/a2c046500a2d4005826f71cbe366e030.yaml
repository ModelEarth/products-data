  ## Product Component Notes

  Steel, 96.1%, Polyester Powder Coating, 3.9%


  ## Source Data Notes

  The supporting LCA study was carried out using BRE LINA v2.0.8 using manufacturer
  specific data provided by SAS International for the production period of the 12
  months of 2017. Raw material quantities have been taken from recorded production/manufacture
  data and product geometry from the Syteline internal production system, for all
  variations of the SAS 320 steel tile only systems made in the 12 month period. SAS
  International manufacture other products in addition to the System 320 so some allocation
  of primary data has been carried out. Since the manufacturing steps responsible
  for slitting, perforating and drying the coated metal are the most energy intensive
  processes of the site, it is assumed that the gas and electricity consumption is
  the same for every m2 of metal product produced. This same allocation was applied
  to total site water usage. Production waste has been allocated to individual products
  by applying a percentage wastage rate (based on historical values and used for stock
  management) to each quantity of raw material. All packaging and non-production waste
  (waste packaging) has also been allocated using this methodology with applied percentage
  based on planned/estimated packaging and waste requirements for each product/system/components.
  Secondary data has been drawn from the BRE LINA database v2.0.29 and the background
  LCI datasets are based on ecoinvent v3.2. Upstream extraction and/or processing
  of inputs are included within the use of the background datasets within LINA. Emissions
  from fuels used are included within the relevant datasets.'
